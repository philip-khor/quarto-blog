One project that tracks that effort is a website called [Carbon Monitor](https://carbonmonitor.org/variation) and boy are we not doing great:\n\n![](images/Screenshot 2023-08-31 172242.png)\n\nOkay, in fairness, that's more like mixed reviews. We're making good progress in power (and somehow the residential sector?) but transport is looking bad, whether ground or air.\n\nI'm no carbon analyst so I'm not sure what to do with the data, but I notice some interesting seasonality: across the world, emissions spike during the work week, but decline during weekends.\n\n![](images/carbonmonitor(4).png)\n\nMore interestingly, for ground transport, emissions consistently increase year-on-year during weekdays, and consistently decrease year-on-year during weekends:\n\n![](images/carbonmonitor.png)\n\nOkay, not really so for the world, but have a look at the US and the EU:\n\n![](images/carbonmonitor(2).png)\n\n![](images/carbonmonitor(1).png)\n\nand in case this was a fluke, I plotted the data by day of week:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\ncarbon <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"carbonmonitor-global_datas_2023-08-31.csv\"), \n                   col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = \"%d/%m/%Y\")))\n\ncarbon_plus1 <- carbon |> mutate(date = date + lubridate::years(1))\n\ncarbon |>\n  left_join(carbon_plus1 |> select(-timestamp),\n            by = c(\"country\", \"date\", \"sector\")) |>\n  drop_na(value.y) |> \n  mutate(\n    diff = value.x - value.y,\n    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1),\n    reduce = diff < 0\n  ) |> \n  filter(year(date) == 2023, sector == \"Ground Transport\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, fill = reduce)) + geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(country), ncol = 3) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"\", y = \"\", \n    title = \"Ground transport emissions have risen during workdays \\nbut not the weekends\", \n    subtitle = \"Days with year-on-year decline in CO2 emissions by day of week\\nGround transport, Jan-Jul 2023\",\n    caption = \"Data from Carbon Monitor\") + \n  scale_fill_hc(limits = c(TRUE, FALSE)) + \n  theme_hc(style = \"darkunica\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"#cbcbcd\")) + guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](decarb_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHonestly not sure what to make of this. EVs perhaps? More likely, it's reflective of the reversal of flexible work arrangements to in-person work in spite of the significant health risks that continue to be posed by Covid-19, and it looks like there are significant climate costs associated with this unfortunate phenomena.\n",

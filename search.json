    "text": "Why bother?\nThat’s a good question. R does work fine with Windows, at least as far as I use it. And in general I think that would be the case for most people. Using R with Windows has the big advantage of having binaries on CRAN available for the latest version of packages. In comparison, Linux does not, however if you use RStudio Package Manager as a package source you’ll have access to package binaries for Linux.\nWith R 4.0, compiling packages requires Rtools4.0, which requires adding the Rtools home to the .Renviron file. While I haven’t had problems with this setup, I’ve seen people facing issues on Twitter. Thank goodness we don’t have to install arbitrary Visual Studio dependencies like with some Python packages …\nEssentially, I think you may want to consider using WSL2 with R if you anticipate having compilation issues for your packages on Windows that could be sidestepped by using Linux.\nDownloading R binaries from conda is a great alternative, but conda’s pretty heavy and I wouldn’t recommend running R from conda in parallel with R, at least on Windows. This is because in my experience, the conda R instance looks for packages in the non-conda package library. This is something that’s being worked on; in addition, if you install packages from GitHub, it’s probably not a great idea to mix that with your conda R library."

But if the client isn’t convinced that it’s useful, you’re not going to get recurring business. The client may not understand the technical merits of your project: you’re going to have to convince them that it is technically sound without getting too absorbed in the details.\nMoreover, even if you’re sharing to your own data science team, some members of your team may not be familiar with the domain you’re working in, and you’re going to have to make similar adjustments to your presentation/reporting to make sure it’s accessible to your audience.\nGranted, our roles weren’t client-facing, but we were challenged to make the systems relevant to the client all the same. One way to do this is to develop or pick metrics that are relevant to the use case, to make sure the client can relate to what you’re talking about.\nAs an example, in the context of regression problems, I strongly prefer using metrics that summarize the distribution of errors, e.g. root mean squared error (RMSE) rather than R-squared. Putting aside the many other downsides of the R-squared, its biggest drawback to me is its rather nuanced and commonly misunderstood definition. Reporting a metric like RMSE or MAPE (mean average percentage error) that’s in the same units as the outcome of interest is more straightforward and makes the metric more meaningful for the client."

On the other hand, the architectures we know about are known to work out for a number of use cases. Going over details of the architectures used is generally just unnecessary, although highlighting key differences between architectures that make a difference to your model’s performance can help your audience to understand your thought process.\nFor instance, in deep learning-based object detection, there is a speed-accuracy trade-off between region proposal network and regression-based architectures.

Alright. Here’s the chart:\n\nLet’s start with what graduate employability means. Honestly, I’ve no clue. The visual tells me nothing about that. Let’s do a quick Google search, shall we?\n\nSERDANG, 6 Mei – Kebolehpasaran graduan Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) menjangkau 82.2 peratus, iaitu yang tertinggi di kalangan institusi pengajian tinggi di negara ini.\nTimbalan Naib Canselor (Hal Ehwal Pelajar dan Alumni) UPM, Prof. Dato’ Dr. Mohammad Shatar Sabran berkata 82.2 peratus daripada graduan UPM memperoleh pekerjaan dalam tempoh tiga bulan selepas konvokesyen mereka. https://upm.edu.my/news/kebolehpasaran_graduan_upm_822_peratus_tertinggi_di_kalangan_ipt-25091?L=bm\n\nOkay, so I presume it measures what percentage of graduates obtained jobs within three months of that convocation. Awesome. We should really just put that in the chart, because calling this “graduate employability” doesn’t tell us much..\nNext, let’s think about how someone using the graphic will understand this chart.\nThe font for the numbers is quite large. But a key part of the visual is the length of the vertical ‘pillars’ supporting each of the ‘bubbles’.\nI’m no expert in perception, but let’s say people take the length of the ‘pillars’ to represent the metric.\nSurely people will think that the employability rate has improved a lot more than it has?\nThe increase of the rate from 2018 to 2019 was 2 percentage points. But we’re interested in the ratio of the 2019 to 2018 percentage. 82/80 implies an increase of 2.5%.\nThe line for 82% is 5 cm on my computer screen whereas the line for 80% is 2.3cm on my screen. That’s a ratio of 2.17 to 1, an increase of 117%.\nPut simply, the graph exaggerates the change in the employability rate by almost 50 times.\nThe cognitive dissonance while processing the chart is stunning. Looking at the chart, I would have thought the Ministry made great progress, while in fact it’s just made a scratch."

The advantage of using marginal odds is that we can get an idea of actual, rather than relative probabilities (see here for details), however they can be quite tricky to interpret. The marginal effect for a continuous variable $X_k$ provides the instantaneous rate of change if the variable $X_k$ increased by an infinitesimal amount $\\Delta$, holding all other variables $X$ constant. See this for details. $$\\lim_{\\Delta \\to 0} \\Pr(Y = 1|X, X_k+\\Delta)- \\Pr(y=1|X, X_k)$$\nIn other words, what is the change in (log-)probabiity if the first principal component changes by an infinitesimal amount?\nThe means of each principal component will coincide with 0, therefore at 0 I get marginal effects at average race/age. This is visualised below."

    "title": "(Individual) tax rebates suck",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you’re one of the 16.5% of employees who pay taxes in Malaysia you may be familiar with the many ways by which you can reduce your tax burden: tax reliefs. From purchases of computers to EPF contributions, there’s so many incentives that the government provides for you to save money, or even get some cash back in the process.\nBut wait a minute, you say. “I’m part of the 16%? The median income in Malaysia was RM5,873 a month in 20191, and I’m barely there.” But well, most of you aren’t your own household. And if you’re a single-earner household, your median income turns out to be just RM2,988 (2019), well below the taxable threshold of around RM3,000 a month. The Salaries and Wages Report, which provides more frequent updates on wage trends, indicates a median income of RM2,250 in 2021.\nSo yeah, if you’re familiar with Borang BE pat yourself on the back. You’re T20, you’ve made it as part of the socioeconomic elite.\nTax rebates are a great way for the government to claim to ‘fix’ problems without actually putting their money where their mouth is. There’s no real expense, just revenue forgone. But in truth, like a reverse Robin Hood, tax rebates steal from the poor to subsidise tax bills for the rich. So when a bunch of experts suggested in the media that tax rebates be used to encourage people to top up their EPF savings, I was rather unhappy.\nTo see why, let’s take a middle-of-the-road employee (‘Person A’) from a T20 household. In 2019, the median income per capita in a T20 household was RM3,854, or RM 46,248 a year2. For comparison, let’s take an individual (‘Person B’) that earns double that, say RM92,496. For the year of assessment 2022, Person A falls under the 8% tax bracket, whereas Person B falls under the 21% tax bracket. Ignoring all applicable tax reliefs, their tax payable would be as follows:\n\n\n\nPerson A\nFirst 35,000\n600\n\n\n\n\n11,248 @ 8%\n900\n1,500\n\n\nPerson B\nFirst 70,000\n4,400\n\n\n\n\n22,496 @ 21%\n4,724\n9,124\n\n\n\nSuppose that both Person A and B enjoy RM1,000 tax relief on top of the standard RM9,000 tax relief (for existing? idk). This reduces chargable income for each of these persons by RM10,000. However, for Person A, tax payable reduces by 800 (RM10,000 \\(\\times\\) 8%), while for Person B tax payable reduces by RM2,100. This means the government has forgone 2.6 times more tax revenue for the richer Person B than for Person A, and makes tax deductions highly regressive: the rich benefit more than the poor.\nPerhaps you object: Person B’s income means he contributes more to society, so he deserves additional relief proportionate to his contribution. Even by that logic, the government has forgone proportionately more revenue than Person B has earned.\nNot to mention that the tax relief system is the bane of ratepayers’ existence: you are required to keep records for several years. Some of us approach the tax authorities for voluntary audits in fear of getting in trouble some point in the future if we’ve misunderstood the tax code.\nNow, there may be a place for tax relief if the intention is to incentivise the rich to do certain pro-social things, for instance engage in risky investments to spur innovation, or even to purchase insurance, where their purchase of insurance could diversify risk pools and contribute to lower premiums. But it would be a lot more equitable to subsidise these behaviours directly. Insurance vouchers, for instance. Or topping up EPF contributions to a minimum, in the style of a negative income tax.\nIf we expanded relief for voluntary contribution to the EPF, only the well-off and financially sound can afford to contribute voluntarily to the EPF at an amount significant enough to make a dent on their tax bill3. Not to lose sight of the fact that while we lobby the government to lower our tax bills, the median savings of EPF members has halved to RM8,100 in 2022 from RM16,600 pre-Covid.\nWe need a real conversation about how to fund social security moving forward, lest retirement means poverty for the aging masses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThis article represents my own opinions and do not represent the opinions of my employer.

    "text": "Learning algorithm\nTraining a GBM begins with initializing a simple model \\(f_0\\), so that the model at iteration 0 is:\n\\[F_0(\n\\textbf{x}\n)=f_0(\\textbf{x})\\]\nwhere \\(\\textbf{x}\\) denotes the feature input vector. \\(f_0\\) may be as simple as the average prediction. For a GBM modelling a single feature, the model may start off looking something like this3:\n\nThe idea behind gradient boosting is to adjust the model sequentially to ‘fix’ the errors.\n\nWhere the actual values are above \\(F_0\\), the model should be adjusted upwards;\nWhere the actual values are below \\(F_0\\), the model should be adjusted downwards;\n\nThe boosting approach to solving this problem is to fit a model to the errors \\(\\epsilon = y-F(\\textbf{x})\\) at every iteration. At every iteration, we add a model of the errors to fix the previous model’s mistakes.\n\nStated differently, the model at the first boosting stage is the sum of the initial model \\(F_0\\) and the model of the residuals \\(f_1\\):\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]Intuitively, the residuals \\(\\epsilon\\) indicate the direction in which the overall model should be nudged to get to the target value.\n\nGradient descent?\nIn practice, the residuals used to fit the learners are computed using the gradient of the loss function, and are also known as pseudoresiduals.\nIf we were to add the entirety of the model of the residuals \\(f_1\\):\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]\nthen it may not be necessary to train for further iterations, since \\(y=F_0(\\textbf{x})+\\epsilon\\)4. So we slow down training by adding only a fraction \\(\\eta\\) of the learner:\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+\\eta f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]\n\\(\\eta\\) is known as the learning rate. It’s also known as a shrinkage parameter, since it shrinks the contribution of each learner to the ensemble.\nOr more generally, for the \\(b\\)-th iteration:\n\\[F_b(\\textbf{x})=F_{b-1}(\\textbf{x})+\\eta f_b(\\textbf{x})\\]\nNotice how this parallels with gradient descent for neural networks, where the direction of adjustment for the \\(j\\)-th model parameter \\(\\theta_j\\) is guided by the sign of the gradient:\n\\[\\theta_{j} =\\theta_{j}-\\eta \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\theta_j}J(\\theta)\\]\nwhere \\(J(\\theta)\\) refers to the loss function.\nWith gradient boosting, the direction of the gradient is used to adjust the overall model directly instead of individual model parameters.\n\n\nHow many trees, then?\nIt follows that lowering the learning rate \\(\\eta\\) generally requires more learners to build an optimal model. By slowing the speed of adjustment, the learning algorithm is more likely to converge, but a large ensemble may be required for an optimal model5.\nAn approach to determining the number of learners required is known as early stopping. Additional learners are added until the point of diminishing returns, where there is no noticeable performance gain for adding new trees.\nSince the model is trained iteratively, it is possible to score the model at every iteration. The early_stopping_rounds argument in XGBoost checks the previous early_stopping_rounds for any improvement in the test score and trains the model for additional rounds only if improvements are observed.\nMake sure to use separate sets of data for determining early stopping rounds and evaluating models."

    "text": "Building interpretable GBMs\nIn some applications, it is necessary to consider additional measures to ensure the trustworthiness of a model.\n\nMonotonic constraints\nIt may be useful to ensure that a GBM is constructed to align with certain ex ante expectations of how a feature is related to the target variable. Monotonic constraints ensure that a specified relationship is either strictly increasing or decreasing. See https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/monotonic.html for details.\n\n\nFeature interaction constraints\nIn tree-based models, each additional level introduces interactions to the model. Interactions are where combinations of feature values matter to the model, and not just individual feature values. The additive structure of GBMs makes it possible to restrict interactions captured in a model by limiting the features used in each iteration.\n\nExplainable Boosting Machines train on one feature at a time and incorporate automatic detection of interactions, such that the resulting model can be directly interpreted by summing up across all trees.\nXGBoost allows users to specify which feature interactions are permitted. As an example, Scotiabank transforms XGBoost models trained with feature interaction constraints into a scorecard format for use in credit assessment."

The weakness of using a linear model for classification problems is that the probabilities can be less than 0 or more than 1, which defies the rules of probability. Len Kiefer explores trimmed OLS for estimating effect sizes, where we eliminate observations where the predicted probabilities are less than 0 or more than 1 first, then re-estimate OLS. The code for trimmed OLS are as follows:\n\n# trimmed OLS\nreg %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  filter(.fitted &lt; 0 | .fitted &gt; 1) -&gt; out_of_bounds\n\ntitanic_training %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(var = '.rownames') %&gt;% \n  anti_join(out_of_bounds, \n            by = \".rownames\") %$%\n  lm(formula, data = .) -&gt; trimmed_ols\n\nAnd now time to evaluate.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In short, we do cross-validation to pick the right model. But what does that mean for our ‘final model’?\nLet’s take a step back and motivate the train-test split approach (otherwise known as the evaluation set approach). Like cross-validation, we perform the evaluation set approach because we want to have some idea of how our model performs in the real world.\n\nThe evaluation set approach\nA simple way to achieve this is to split our data so that the model is *trained* on one part of the data, and *evaluated* on the other part (‘holdout’). This is what we see at the start of most machine learning courses:\n\n\n\nevaluation set approach\n\n\nIn Python, this is what we do when we call train_test_split() from sklearn:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 0.3)\nfor R users, using the tidymodels infrastructure, rsample can be used to split training and holdout sets:\nlibrary(rsample) \n\ncar_split &lt;- initial_split(mtcars)\ntrain_data &lt;- training(car_split)\ntest_data &lt;- testing(car_split)\n\n\nTraining on the evaluation set\nUnfortunately for us, in practice, we use the holdout set a lot more than once. Today’s data scientist is spoiled for choice when it comes to algorithms: for gradient boosting alone, you have XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting, gbm etc., not to mention the numerous hyperparameters you have for any one algorithm. If you use the holdout set to guide your choice of hyperparameters, you are bound to overfit on your holdout set.\nThe no-free-lunch theorem further complicates this problem. Loosely speaking, the no-free-lunch theorem asserts that there is no One True Algorithm that has superior performance across all use cases. Given the above, the data scientist would have to test the algorithm multiple times to see which works best. With the evaluation set approach, this amounts to training on the holdout set.\n\n\nAnother holdout set\nIf you put this question up to the deep learning folks, they’ll provide you a seemingly simple solution: create two holdout sets. Pick the correct model on Holdout 1 (‘validation’), then evaluate the final model on Holdout 2 (‘holdout’):\n\n\n\ntrain, validation, holdout\n\n\nThis may not be ideal sometimes because:\n1. data is often limited: there may not be enough data for two holdout sets. Moreover, in cases where observations are time-sensitive, a TVH approach could reduce the generalizability of the chosen model if the time period of the shrinked training set is less relevant to the problem at hand.\n2. Additionally, depending on the observations picked in validation/holdout, test error can be highly variable (see ISLR for details).\n\n\nK-fold cross-validation\nAnd so we move on to cross-validation, in hopes that we can get around this limited-data problem. This diagram may be familiar to some of you:\n\n\n\n5-fold cross-validation\n\n\nIn (k-fold) cross-validation, we try to get at some semblance of generalization performance by resampling the development data. Slicing the development data into 5 folds, we train the data on 4 folds, and validate the resulting model on the remaining fold. We repeat this for each permutation of folds, and then average the validation score to obtain the cross-validated score.\n\n\nWhich is the final model?\nWhile performing cross-validation, we have trained K models to evaluate our training procedure. Which should be the final model?\nNone of the above! The purpose of cross-validation is merely to pick the correct procedure for fitting a model. Whether it be the algorithm or the hyperparameter search space, the purpose of cross-validation is to know what procedure works best for your data. The same procedure can be reused to re-fit the model on new data, and that should make up your final model.\n\nThe purpose of cross-validation is model checking, not model building (StackExchange)\n\nIn fact, once you’re done with cross-validation and picked your final model, you can, and should, re-train your model-building procedure on all the data you have. There is no reason to drop the holdout set once the optimal procedure has been selected."

No single model from the cross-validation process should actually be used as your final model1; cross-validation is merely a way to evaluate how well your modeling process works on repeated samples of your data, to get a better sense of how well your modeling choice works in the real world.\nIf you’re comparing estimator-to-estimator without tuning much, you’re at pretty low risk of overestimating model performance from model selection, so long as you don’t peek at your test set. Suppose I had three simple models:\ndict(zip(\n  [\"GaussianNB\", \"LogisticRegression\", \"RandomForestClassifier\"], \n  [round(i, 3) for i in [nb_scores.mean(), lr_scores.mean(), rf_scores.mean()]]\n))\n\n{'GaussianNB': 0.939, 'LogisticRegression': 0.947, 'RandomForestClassifier': 0.953}\nFrom the scores above, it seems that RandomForestClassifier should perform best out-of-sample."

    "text": "What about hyperparameter tuning?\nI specifically chose these three estimators because they require minimal tuning. However, modern gradient boosting frameworks such as LightGBM and XGBoost have a lot of hyperparameters to choose from, and rarely do modellers have ways to guide hyperparameter choices.\nTaking elastic net as an example, where the regularization term is a mix of L1 and L2 penalties:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big( y^{(i)} - \\hat{y}^{(i)}  \\big)^2 + \\lambda_1 \\sum^{m}_{j=1} w_{j}^2+ \\lambda_2 \\sum^{m}_{j=1} |w_j|\n\\] which is sometimes restated to establish a ‘mixing parameter’ \\(\\alpha\\) (e.g. glmnet):\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big( y^{(i)} - \\hat{y}^{(i)}  \\big)^2 + \\lambda\\left[ \\frac {1-\\alpha}{2}\\sum^{m}_{j=1} w_{j}^2+\\alpha \\sum^{m}_{j=1} |w_j|\\right]\n\\]\nThe choice between L1 and L2 regularization can be guided by our hypotheses of how the feature set affects the target. For instance, if many features do not affect the target, a higher mix of L1 penalty may be more appropriate, whereas if each feature contributes a little to the target, the L2 penalty would be more appropriate. However, it is not clear how to pick the regularization term \\(\\lambda\\)."

    "text": "Putting the ‘tuning’ in hyperparameter tuning\nIn practice, the data scientist probably does a little more than that. Recall that grid search exhausts the search space we specify. Since we specified two values for both C and kernel, the size of the grid is merely 4. A continuous search space is infinitely large :-(\n\nYou, the data scientist\nYou may not be satisfied with the predictive performance of the model we obtain, and as such you may try to search around the search space for a better hyperparameter value.\nSuppose you start with\nparameters = {'kernel':('linear', 'rbf'), 'C':[1, 10]}\nfind out RBF and C = 10 were selected by your search process, then proceed to run\nparameters = {'kernel': 'rbf', 'C':[9, 10, 11]}\nhoping to get better performance.\nThe problem is that you are almost certain to get better performance, since you are optimizing for the same cross-validation scheme. We’ve violated the rule that cross-validation is just for evaluation, and inadvertently used it for optimizing our model!\n\n\nWait … what just happened?\nTo see why this is an issue, let’s simplify this problem a little by substituting cross-validation with a validation set approach. Suppose you used a train-validation split on your data and used the test score to guide your hyperparameter choice. And suppose our results looked a little like:\n\n\n\nC\nkernel\ntest score\n\n\n\n\n1\nlinear\n.95\n\n\n1\nrbf\n.91\n\n\n10\nlinear\n.96\n\n\n10\nrbf\n.90\n\n\n\nNow you know that 10 and linear are optimal, so you search around the vicinity of C = 10.\n\n\n\nC\nkernel\ntest score\n\n\n\n\n8\nlinear\n.92\n\n\n9\nlinear\n.93\n\n\n10\nlinear\n.96\n\n\n11\nlinear\n.97\n\n\n\nThis has muddied the train-evaluation distinction. We ‘train’ our model using our observations for the evaluation set. You’d be hacking the test set for the best score, and the test score loses its efficacy as an indicator of your model’s performance. We will choose the hyperparameter that performs best on the test set, but its generalizability is questionable.\n\n\nCan cross-validation save us?\nUsing cross-validation may not be enough. Suppose we had cross-validation split 1 with the following evaluation scores:\n\n\n\nC\nkernel\ncross-validated\n\n\n\n\n1\nlinear\n.95\n\n\n1\nrbf\n.91\n\n\n10\nlinear\n.96\n\n\n10\nrbf\n.90\n\n\n\nand again searched around the vicinity of C = 10:\n\n\n\nC\nkernel\ncross-validated\n\n\n\n\n8\nlinear\n.92\n\n\n9\nlinear\n.93\n\n\n10\nlinear\n.96\n\n\n11\nlinear\n.97\n\n\n\nyou would be selecting the hyperparameters that are optimal for the cross-validation setup, since the hyperparameter optimization process shares the same cross-validation setup as the hyperparameter evaluation process. This time, instead of hacking the test set, you’re hacking the cross-validation setup.\nAs a result, the cross-validation error you obtain from this process would be overoptimistic."

Instead of cross-validating a set of hyperparameters, we want to benchmark the performance of a hyperparameter search process over K folds of the dataset. This brings us back to the standard cross-validation definition:\n\n\nTrain the hyperparameter search process on folds 2-5, then test on fold 1;\nTrain the hyperparameter search process on folds 1, 3-5, then test on fold 2;\nTrain the hyperparameter search process on folds 1-2, 4-5, then test on fold 3;\nTrain the hyperparameter search process on folds 1-3, 5; then test on fold 4;\nTrain the hyperparameter search process on folds 1-4; then test on fold 5;\n\nand finally, average the performance on each of the test folds.\n\n\nBringing in hyperparameter search\nNow, we would like the hyperparameter search process to be cross-validated as well. So within the hyperparameter search process, we define a different cross-validation configuration. In scikit-learn, this will look like:\n\np_grid = {\n  \"C\": [1, 10, 100],\n  \"kernel\": [\"rbf\", \"linear\"]\n}\n          \nsvm = SVC()\ninner_cv = KFold(n_splits=4, shuffle=True)\nouter_cv = KFold(n_splits=4, shuffle=True)\nclf = GridSearchCV(estimator=svm, param_grid=p_grid, cv=inner_cv)\nnested_score = cross_val_score(clf, X=X, y=y, cv=outer_cv)\nprint(nested_score)\n\n[0.95804196 0.97183099 0.93661972 0.93661972]\n\n\nAnd once you’ve found a search space you’re happy with, refit the GridSearchCV object:\n\nclf.fit(X, y)\n\nGridSearchCV(cv=KFold(n_splits=4, random_state=None, shuffle=True),\n             estimator=SVC(),\n             param_grid={'C': [1, 10, 100], 'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear']})In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

This is perfectly fine, as we are now trying to evaluate which hyperparameter search space/process works best, not which set of hyperparameters works best.\nThe final test set may have another set of hyperparameters.\nWhen you eventually retrain on all the data you have, you may get a different set of hyperparameters! But that’s okay, because at the end of the day, we’re evaluating a process for fitting the model, not a set of hyperparameters."

We designed our material in Jupyter Notebooks, where out-of-order execution was an issue. In the context of material designed in Jupyter Notebooks, a no-side-effects workflow is advantageous, since if you run cells out of order, you could potentially get different results.

An example how this helps is how it may be easier to teach functional programming in purrr compared to base R, since the multivariate versions of the apply functions contain the data within the ellipsis argument, which is the last argument, versus with lapply()/sapply() where the data is the first argument.\nThe tidyverse is designed as a grammar, or perhaps a way to speak about the operations you’re running. dplyr is the tidyverse’s grammar for manipulating tabular data encapsulated in 6 verbs and their variants, whereas ggplot2 is the tidyverse’s grammar for constructing charts.\nWithin the tidyverse grammar, every function is a verb.

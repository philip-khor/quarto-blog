    "text": "Why bother?\nThat’s a good question. R does work fine with Windows, at least as far as I use it. And in general I think that would be the case for most people. Using R with Windows has the big advantage of having binaries on CRAN available for the latest version of packages. In comparison, Linux does not, however if you use RStudio Package Manager as a package source you’ll have access to package binaries for Linux.\nWith R 4.0, compiling packages requires Rtools4.0, which requires adding the Rtools home to the .Renviron file. While I haven’t had problems with this setup, I’ve seen people facing issues on Twitter. Thank goodness we don’t have to install arbitrary Visual Studio dependencies like with some Python packages …\nEssentially, I think you may want to consider using WSL2 with R if you anticipate having compilation issues for your packages on Windows that could be sidestepped by using Linux.\nDownloading R binaries from conda is a great alternative, but conda’s pretty heavy and I wouldn’t recommend running R from conda in parallel with R, at least on Windows. This is because in my experience, the conda R instance looks for packages in the non-conda package library. This is something that’s being worked on; in addition, if you install packages from GitHub, it’s probably not a great idea to mix that with your conda R library."

But if the client isn’t convinced that it’s useful, you’re not going to get recurring business. The client may not understand the technical merits of your project: you’re going to have to convince them that it is technically sound without getting too absorbed in the details.\nMoreover, even if you’re sharing to your own data science team, some members of your team may not be familiar with the domain you’re working in, and you’re going to have to make similar adjustments to your presentation/reporting to make sure it’s accessible to your audience.\nGranted, our roles weren’t client-facing, but we were challenged to make the systems relevant to the client all the same. One way to do this is to develop or pick metrics that are relevant to the use case, to make sure the client can relate to what you’re talking about.\nAs an example, in the context of regression problems, I strongly prefer using metrics that summarize the distribution of errors, e.g. root mean squared error (RMSE) rather than R-squared. Putting aside the many other downsides of the R-squared, its biggest drawback to me is its rather nuanced and commonly misunderstood definition. Reporting a metric like RMSE or MAPE (mean average percentage error) that’s in the same units as the outcome of interest is more straightforward and makes the metric more meaningful for the client."

On the other hand, the architectures we know about are known to work out for a number of use cases. Going over details of the architectures used is generally just unnecessary, although highlighting key differences between architectures that make a difference to your model’s performance can help your audience to understand your thought process.\nFor instance, in deep learning-based object detection, there is a speed-accuracy trade-off between region proposal network and regression-based architectures.

Alright. Here’s the chart:\n\nLet’s start with what graduate employability means. Honestly, I’ve no clue. The visual tells me nothing about that. Let’s do a quick Google search, shall we?\n\nSERDANG, 6 Mei – Kebolehpasaran graduan Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) menjangkau 82.2 peratus, iaitu yang tertinggi di kalangan institusi pengajian tinggi di negara ini.\nTimbalan Naib Canselor (Hal Ehwal Pelajar dan Alumni) UPM, Prof. Dato’ Dr. Mohammad Shatar Sabran berkata 82.2 peratus daripada graduan UPM memperoleh pekerjaan dalam tempoh tiga bulan selepas konvokesyen mereka. https://upm.edu.my/news/kebolehpasaran_graduan_upm_822_peratus_tertinggi_di_kalangan_ipt-25091?L=bm\n\nOkay, so I presume it measures what percentage of graduates obtained jobs within three months of that convocation. Awesome. We should really just put that in the chart, because calling this “graduate employability” doesn’t tell us much..\nNext, let’s think about how someone using the graphic will understand this chart.\nThe font for the numbers is quite large. But a key part of the visual is the length of the vertical ‘pillars’ supporting each of the ‘bubbles’.\nI’m no expert in perception, but let’s say people take the length of the ‘pillars’ to represent the metric.\nSurely people will think that the employability rate has improved a lot more than it has?\nThe increase of the rate from 2018 to 2019 was 2 percentage points. But we’re interested in the ratio of the 2019 to 2018 percentage. 82/80 implies an increase of 2.5%.\nThe line for 82% is 5 cm on my computer screen whereas the line for 80% is 2.3cm on my screen. That’s a ratio of 2.17 to 1, an increase of 117%.\nPut simply, the graph exaggerates the change in the employability rate by almost 50 times.\nThe cognitive dissonance while processing the chart is stunning. Looking at the chart, I would have thought the Ministry made great progress, while in fact it’s just made a scratch."

The advantage of using marginal odds is that we can get an idea of actual, rather than relative probabilities (see here for details), however they can be quite tricky to interpret. The marginal effect for a continuous variable $X_k$ provides the instantaneous rate of change if the variable $X_k$ increased by an infinitesimal amount $\\Delta$, holding all other variables $X$ constant. See this for details. $$\\lim_{\\Delta \\to 0} \\Pr(Y = 1|X, X_k+\\Delta)- \\Pr(y=1|X, X_k)$$\nIn other words, what is the change in (log-)probabiity if the first principal component changes by an infinitesimal amount?\nThe means of each principal component will coincide with 0, therefore at 0 I get marginal effects at average race/age. This is visualised below."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis article was first published in the April 2024 issue of Penang Monthly.\nTaylor Swift, the queen of pop, transcends the realm of music. She’s a cultural force, a brand powerhouse, and according to Swifties in political leadership, a significant economic driver. Her relatable lyrics, narrative-driven albums, and social media engagement create a sense of community and shared experience. This fervent fanbase translates into dedicated concertgoers, enthusiastic merchandise buyers, and a loyal consumer base that fuels Swiftonomics.\nIntriguingly, Taylor Swift’s critically acclaimed Eras Tour has sparked bad blood within ASEAN. Leaders across Thailand and the Philippines have criticised Singapore for entering an agreement with Swift’s team to host concerts exclusively in Southeast Asia. Uncharacteristically, Malaysia’s traditionally concert-averse conservative bloc has joined the Swiftian gold rush, with Bersatu leader Sasha Lyna Abdul Latiff asking the Anwar administration to explain the outcome of past negotiations between the Malaysian government and Taylor Swift’s team during the Ismail Sabri administration.\nASEAN leaders wish Taylor Swift would schedule a concert in their respective countries, not purely out of fear of missing out. The Eras Tour is the first tour to gross over USD 1 billion globally, and its companion concert film, ‘Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour’, topped the record for highest-grossing concert film at over USD 261 billion, more than doubling the previous record held by ‘Justin Bieber: Never Say Never’ in 2011. The US leg of the Eras Tour generated USD 4.6 billion in direct consumer spending on expenses, including tickets, outfits, merchandise, food & beverages and travel, according to QuestionPro estimates. At the same time, Economic Effects NET named the Eras Tour Japan’s biggest-ever music event by economic impact, generating USD 229.6 million across four Tokyo shows. Even so, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman wonders out loud, why doesn’t Taylor Swift earn more than she does?"

    "text": "Look What You Made Singapore Do\nBeyond short-term gains, Singapore bets on the Eras Tour and other mega-events to improve its allure to global entertainment acts, riding on the back of pent-up demand following the relaxation of COVID-19 public health restrictions across the globe. While the island-state may lack homegrown cultural credentials, it isn’t for lack of trying. In 2012, Gallup ranked Singaporeans as the most emotionless people globally. Now graced by the likes of Bruno Mars, Coldplay, and Ed Sheeran, Singapore is banking on their halo effect to rehabilitate its image into Asia’s “events and entertainment capital”. \nThe appeal of mega-events has historically been a double-edged sword. World leaders’ pleas for Taylor Swift’s patronage echo the race for Olympic host nations in not-too-distant memory. Concerns about environmental impact, fueled by Taylor Swift’s sizable carbon footprint from private jet travel, loom large. Estimates for 2022—during which Taylor Swift was not touring—suggest that her private jet travel produced a whopping 8,300 tonnes of carbon emissions, equivalent to 1,800 (average) human beings in a year. \nMoreover, it is unclear how the benefits of a Taylor Swift tour stop will be distributed within local communities. Matherson (2004) argues that businesses reap the lion’s share of the profits from mega-events, which are unlikely to recirculate in the economy. Further, KPMG estimates that of the just over AUD 100 million profit that Taylor Swift is to earn from the Australian leg of the Eras Tour, the net impact of the tour on the Australian economy would be just a tenth of that: AUD 10.6 million, equivalent to 0.002% of Australia’s quarterly gross domestic product (GDP)."

    "text": "I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor’s Version?)\nBack home, concert enthusiasts in Malaysia have endured disappointment after disappointment. With Malaysia’s reputation for shutting down concerts in response to protests over performers’ stagewear, the Eras Tour snub comes on the heels of opposition to Coldplay’s November 2023 Malaysia show over their support for gender diversity. \nFormer Minister of Youth and Sports Syed Saddiq characterised the cancellation of Malaysian Coldplay tour dates as missing “an economic lottery”, citing substantial spillovers in the transport and F&B sector. Likewise, the Arts, Live Festival and Events Association lamented the impact of protests on “our international business environment and reputation”, citing “millions in tourist income and benefit hotels, transportation, food and beverage, retail and more” resulting from Coldplay’s six sold-out shows in Singapore. \nThe uncertain business environment this has brought about bodes poorly for the local entertainment industry. Singapore’s successful efforts in ensuring a Swift landing must be viewed in light of its historical disadvantage in homegrown talent, in which Malaysia arguably has the upper hand. However, multiple factors in Malaysia threaten to suppress local cultural dynamics. The allure of dominant international acts such as Taylor Swift overshadows the real problems faced by local Malaysian artists, constrained as they are by shifting goalposts.\nIt is of little comfort that much of the purported spillover effects of mega-events are, more often than not, an exaggeration. Economically, Malaysia has little to lose beyond the creative economy, which contributes just under 2% of GDP (2019), if it resists the Taylor Swift FOMO plaguing the ASEAN region. For any administration in power, the uncertain economic benefits are not worth incurring confrontation from religious fundamentalists. The prospect of Malaysia becoming a regional destination for megastars, as Singapore aspires to be, is politically infeasible."

    "section": "A Cause for Concern: Low EPF Savings",
    "text": "A Cause for Concern: Low EPF Savings\nThe introduction of Account 3 comes amid growing concern about Malaysians’ insufficient retirement savings in their EPF accounts. Recent reports indicate that many contributors, particularly those under 55, have critically low savings.\nAs of 2022, the median savings of active EPF members aged 54 was RM132,8261: in other words, 50% of active members retiring in 2022 have less than RM132,826 available for retirement, or equivalently, just over RM550 a month to spend over 20 years of life. This falls dramatically short of the minimum threshold set by the EPF, known as the Basic Savings Quantum, of RM240,0002at age 55, equivalent to RM1,000 per month for the next 20 years.\nOn an age-adjusted basis, the EPF estimates that as of May 2023, the share of members aged 18 to 55 meeting the basic savings requirement has declined from 20.4% pre-pandemic to 18.4% post-pandemic3.\nFurthermore, the share of Malaysia’s population covered by old-age protection is shockingly low; according to EPF estimates as of December 2023, three in five (or 58%) working-age adults do not have old-age protection, whether from active EPF contributions or the civil service pension scheme—a trend that is exacerbated with the rising popularity of informal employment4.\nMalaysians’ retirement savings shortfall is a long standing issue worsened by policies accompanying the Movement Control Orders (MCOs) imposed at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. As government aid packages proved inadequate, the government initiated four special withdrawal programmes permitting EPF members to withdraw from their retirement savings. Economist Muhammed Abdul Khalid was quoted in a Channel News Asia article criticising the move as “the worst policy ever [that] the country has announced and implemented”.\n\nWhen comparing EPF reports for 2019 and 2022, the magnitude of the depletion of savings for the most vulnerable EPF members is substantial. Across all active EPF members—although a quarter have more than RM100,000 in savings—another one in four members had less than RM10,000 in 2019, the rate of which has since risen to over one in three in 2022. Just under half (49.4%) of EPF members had less than RM35,000 in savings in 2019; median savings across active members has since fallen to around RM25,000 in 2022—a decline of about RM10,000. While the middle half of EPF members had RM10,000 to RM100,000 in savings in 2019, that range has since expanded to RM4,500 to RM100,000 in 2022.\n\nMoreover, the burden of the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on younger cohorts. Between 2019 and 2022, average savings for the under-25 and 26-to-35 cohorts have declined by 32% and 23% respectively, while savings for older cohorts were virtually unchanged, with the 46 to 55 cohort seeing an increase in savings.\n\n\n\nThe youngest members have suffered the largest proportional decrease in savings\n\n\nThe pensions provider is not to blame. The EPF is well-regarded for producing consistent and substantial returns. Benchmarked against individual earnings, it performs on par with East Asian counterparts and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies: net pension wealth is 10.9 times individual net earnings for lower-earning men and women, compared to 13.6 (men) and 15 (women) times in the OECD5.\nRather, inadequate wages coupled with stagnating and uneven income growth is the primary driver for lacklustre retirement savings. Half of Malaysians working in the formal sector earn less than RM2,600 a month (Formal Sector Wages, Q3 2023), and 23.2% (2022) of employment in Malaysia lies in the informal sector. An article in Penang Monthly’s January 2024 issue highlights how wages for semi-skilled workers grew by just 3.5% per annum between 2010 and 2022, even as low-skilled workers registered 5.7% in income growth, bolstered by minimum wage mandates6.\nIn a bid to build retirement savings, the government raised the voluntary contribution limit to RM100,000 per year in the 2023 Budget, up from RM60,000. Although contributions have risen by 15% from 20227 with just a quarter of active EPF members having more than RM100,000 in retirement savings, the policy does not help the majority of EPF members, although it may have been geared to shore up liquidity in anticipation of Account 3. Likewise, the Private Retirement Scheme introduced in 2012, while vital to liberalising the pension funds markets, should not be viewed as a solution for Malaysia’s retirement savings conundrum.\nWorse yet, Malaysian households are highly indebted. In February 2024, household debt registered double-digit year-on-year growth in all segments except for personal use loans8. At 84.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in December 20239, Malaysia’s households accrued a high level of household debt, driven by an unbridled homeownership policy and car-centric urban planning. Debt repayments place considerable pressure on households’ ability to save, calling into question the use of strategies to boost savings as a fix for Malaysia’s retirement woes.\nIn the longer term, Malaysia’s ageing population is poised to further strain EPF members’ and government coffers. Today, the average 55-year-old Malaysian can expect to live 23.5 more years, which means that retirement savings will have to last over longer lifespans. At the same time, the EPF will have to deal with the consequences of a shrinking old-age support ratio on its asset mix as withdrawals outpace contributions.\nAt the fiscal level, it will be challenging for the government to finance additional old-age income security with declining tax revenue collected from a shrinking working-age population. Ironically, with the government declining to rationalise pensions for current civil servants, civil service pensions will continue to strain the government’s fiscal position in the near future10."

    "text": "The EPF: One of Many Free Lunches\nEinstein is, perhaps mistakenly, often credited with the quote that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. Indeed, with the EPF’s excellent track record of consistently paying around 5% in dividends each year, it would take just over 14 years to double your EPF contributions11.\nPolicymakers in Malaysia seem to concur, banking on the power of compound interest to support anything from children’s tertiary education (via the Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional—PTPTN) to retirement savings. In a way, the Malaysian approach attempts to control social spending by relying on dividends to support social goals.\nFor an example of this thinking, inspired by the establishment of Bank Rakyat, which has paid consistent double-digit dividends to its shareholders, former Tabung Haji chairman, Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim, proposed in parliamentary debates the formulation of a new bank—Bank Rakyat 2.0—as a means to provide substantial dividends, particularly to lower-income communities12.\nUnfortunately, this formula may be economically counterproductive and reinforces existing social inequalities. In a blog post, economist, Hafiz Noor Shams, posits that Malaysia’s landscape of high-return, risk-free investments, from Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) to Tabung Haji, caters primarily to the already affluent and serves to the detriment of productive economic activity13.\nThe fledgling economics student is taught the mantra, “There is no free lunch.” The same applies to risk—investors need to be compensated with higher returns if they are to take on more risks. In an environment saturated with risk-free opportunities, households would be less likely to supply capital to productive investments, whether it be channelling money towards the financial markets or starting a business.\nWith 62% of its investments in the domestic market14, the EPF acknowledged the risk of “crowding out” domestic entrepreneurship in a 2023 interview with The Edge, although it does not believe it has crossed that juncture.\nMoreover, relying solely on compound interest is of little help to members with limited income available for savings. 6.9% of the richest EPF members in 2022 hold almost half (49%) of active members’ savings, down from around 10% in 2022 (10.6% of members hold 52.5% of savings). Even more jarring, Hafiz observes how the top 1% of Tabung Haji depositors contribute half of the savings in the fund.\nPersons involved in the informal sector, in particular, face volatile income streams, which may discourage them from contributing to the EPF. For them, design tweaks to the pensions system, such as Account 3, may provide peace of mind, knowing that their EPF contributions do not compromise their ability to deal with rainy-day expenses.\nIndeed, Bank Negara Malaysia emphasises in its Economic and Monetary Review 2022 that long-term reforms are required to fix the structural issues underlying Malaysia’s low levels of retirement savings—in particular low wages, low savings and low informal sector coverage."

    "text": "What to Consider\nAccount 3 strikes a balance between relaxing the prescriptive nature of Account 2 withdrawals and tightening the discipline of Account 1. With the introduction of Account 3, the revised EPF structure is a fair trade-off between increased flexibility and retirement security. Although withdrawals are more readily available than before, the flexible component of retirement contributions has, in fact, declined.\nHowever, with many members’ savings depleted, at merely 10% of contributions, Account 3 will not be a substantial nor a sustainable safety net for most. Moreover, the one in three active members who has less than RM10,000 in retirement savings is faced with the prospect of withdrawing more than 10% of their retirement savings.\nImportantly, Account 3 must not be regarded as an expansion of the social safety net. Rather, it is a compromise forced by the precedent of MCO-era policies allowing EPF withdrawals to fill the gaps of the social safety net. Therefore, it is laudable that the share of contributions flowing to Account 1 have been raised to preserve retirement savings and limit outflows that may be triggered by a hypothetical future withdrawals programme.\nCrucially, the authorities must pursue bold strategies to raise wages to truly help households keep up with the cost of living and replenish retirement funds, such as:\n\nRestoring workers’ bargaining power: tackling Malaysia’s dwindling unionisation rate and enhancing labour dispute resolution systems may raise wages and improve working conditions.\nAccelerate women’s participation in the workplace: by pursuing shared parental leave policies, promoting flexible work arrangements and preventing discrimination in the workplace, dismantling roadblocks to women’s participation in the workforce has the potential to double income sources within families.\nExpanding the availability of support services: services such as financial planning and career guidance alongside a comprehensive social safety net can support upskilling, reskilling, entrepreneurship and other productive, enterprising pursuits.\nHolistic strategies to promote well-being at the workplace: by tackling hazards such as extreme temperatures, accidents and diseases, workers’ earnings potential can be sustained and prolonged across their life course."

    "text": "Not the post-Covid you’re thinking of\nWhile the public health emergency may have sunset, what has not is how 2020 marked a pivotal turning point in the science of disease transmission. Concerns about the air extend to more than just covid. Every pathogen that can transmit through air droplets is implicated, including rapidly spreading pathogens like measles and future novel airborne pathogens.\nEarly on in the pandemic, aerosol engineer Lindsey Marr wondered why a January 2020 article in the New York Times communicated that coronaviruses travelled shorter distances than viruses like measles, when her prior work on the flu virus suggested that SARS-Cov2 should be treated like any other airborne pollutant. Subsequent research about airborne transmission provided an explanation for bizarre superspreader events that couldn’t be explained by the widely accepted idea that surface transmission was the dominant route for transmission of diseases like covid-19, such as how covid-19 could spread across a room despite the then-accepted idea that airborne droplets travel no more than 2 metres.\n\nThe simple implication of the science of airborne pathogens tells us is that in a ‘post-Covid’ society, the air must be cleaned Unlike vaccines, cleaning the air is a variant-proof solution. Moreover, there are clear co-benefits of cleaning the air: a worldwide study reveals that short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contributes to roughly 1 million premature deaths annually. I am fortunate to be in Asian society where people have generally fallen in line with the use of high-quality masks even-as vital protection against disease, but it’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll last.\nNo thanks to incoherent public health messaging, societal norms do not reflect any understanding of the airborne route of disease transmission, from masks off for photos to indoor meals, and now with everyone ‘forgetting’ Covid-19, masks off altogether. At the height of the pandemic, the WHO and other public health agencies have consistently failed to acknowledge the prominence of the airborne route for transmission of SARS-Cov2. Up until very recently, local and international health agencies have consistently placed recommendations for hand hygiene above air hygiene measures in public health communication.\nTo the credit of the public health authorities, there has been a quiet shift in their position on the importance of cleaning indoor air. The new CDC recommendations stress the importance of air filtration and ventilation, and as early as 2021 Malaysia’s DOSH has issued air quality guidelines for commercial and residential settings. Yet thanks to public health authorities dragging their feet on acknowledging the science at the height of the pandemic, people have abdicated their responsibilities to mitigate airborne infection altogether, resulting in fundamentally unsafe public spaces. Consequently, health authorities in the US have watered down recommendations to align with what society can accept, even when the science dictates otherwise.\nEven though novel solutions such as UV-C and C-R boxes have been developed to complement HEPA filters and other solutions, the general public has been hoodwinked into thinking that nothing can and should be done to reduce disease transmission."

    "text": "Multi-system consequences\nThe pandemic thus far has been devastating to humanity. The Economist estimated the toll of the pandemic to be 35mil up to March 2024, just over Malaysia’s total population. Estimates of life expectancy suggest that Covid-19 has resulted in a loss of life expectancy at birth of 1.6 years, the largest drop since the Second World War. The costs of the pandemic, however, stretch far beyond mortality. The narrow framing of the health consequences of Covid-19 in terms of hospitalisations and deaths has led policymakers to ignore the chronic phase of Covid disease, colloquially known as Long Covid.\nLong Covid parallels Nassim Taleb’s description of ‘black-swan events’: low-likelihood, high-impact situations that are not often incorporated in people’s risk calculus. However, absent mitigation, the chances of contracting Long Covid would certainly not qualify as a black swan event. Estimates of the incidence of long-term complications from Covid infection range from 10-50% per infection. Moreover, Covid-19 isn’t subject to the same seasonality as the flu, with people contracting 2-3 infections a year.\n\n\nMuch has been documented about the consequences suffered by Long Covid patients, some of them who may have contracted Covid despite not exhibiting symptoms. There is no known cure for the disease. Some experts describe Covid as “not a disease of the lungs at all” but rather a “vascular and neurologic infection”. Moreover, the cognitive consequences of Long Covid are striking, equivalent to 10 years of aging. It is bizarre that Covid-19 isn’t treated as a serious occupational hazard. Rather, the consequences are so dire and rampant, a Californian court opined that were it to be treated as the occupational hazard that it is, the court would be brought to a standstill. Health issues that have classically been understood as non-communicable diseases are now literally airborne, yet the consequences of that have barely registered among policymakers.\nDavid Cutler published estimates of the economic cost of Long Covid at 3.7 trillion USD, or 17% of 2019 US GDP. In an online forum organised by a US-based insurer, he expressed that the magnitude of the problem is such that there is no amount of investment towards preventing and curing Long Covid that would not be worth it. Young people stand to lose the most from Long Covid with more life-years, children are not spared, with estimates suggesting some 5.8 million children in the US suffer from Long Covid."

Moreover, considering the rapid evolution of covid-19 and especially the lack of available updated vaccines in our part of the world, calling for covid-19 precautions to be lifted is beyond premature. It has been established that vaccine-induced immunity to Covid-19 drops sharply in less than a year, and it should be clear that vaccine-acquired immunity is much safer than infection-acquired immunity.\nSome reassure us that we are not in 2021. We certainly are not: vaccines have not kept pace with the rapid mutation of Sars-Cov2. Malaysia has only had access to vaccines based on the 2020 strain of the virus thus far. Availability of current vaccines is limited.\nDespite this, society has been lulled into a false sense of security powered by groupthink. But groupthink logic is counterproductive in an active pandemic: when less people take precautions that reduce the risk for other people, the higher the risk for everyone else. Complacency about airborne pathogens is widespread amid the complete abdication of airborne disease mitigations. Generations to come will suffer for public intellectuals and politicians’ willful ignorance to avoid footing the costs of the practical and sensible normalisation of air filtration and ventilation measures."

To add insult to injury, thought leaders continue to normalise in-person, unmasked superspreader events, accelerating the spread and mutations of and beyond covid-19, without regard for how in-person events exclude geographically distinct communities from vital policy conversations.\nRTO in an active pandemic is a marker of the devaluation of knowledge work: knowledge workers are being infantalised when employers tell them that they have to come in the office to be productive. It is no wonder that there’s barely a squeak about the knowledge economy, when the implied consensus of the public’s nihilistic approach to Covid is that cognitive ability no longer matters.\nIn addition to the potential to inflict long-term loss of health and life, the accelerating and looming threat of climate change makes it reckless to engage in activities that involve substantial, repeated travel considering the urgency of de-escalating emissions. WFH has been shown to cut over half of carbon emissions relative to in-person work, and that doesn’t even include carbon-intensive work flights that could be conducted over an hour-long Zoom meeting. Thought leaders feign ignorance of how surface temperature records have been broken for each of the past 12 months, even as researchers continue to be stunned by ocean temperature measurements."

The semiconductor industry continues to cram an increasing number of elements onto integrated circuits1. In 1965, Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel, predicted that the number of transistors on chips would double every two years, a phenomenon referred to as Moore’s Law. Remarkably, the industry has mostly kept pace with Moore’s prediction—Apple’s M2 Ultra, for example, contains a staggering 134 billion transistors.\nMiniaturisation may be hitting a wall, but chip advancements are surging ahead. Design innovations like improved architecture and 3D stacking are cramming more power into existing transistors. For instance, Apple’s groundbreaking M-series chips condense immense processing power for next-generation smartphones and laptops. Specialised AI chips further accelerate application-specific performance, while innovations in compound semiconductors like silicon carbide and gallium nitride promise breakthroughs in data centres, cars, and communications."

    "text": "Chip manufacturing\nA marvel of engineering and a poster child for globalisation, the semiconductor industry thrives on a complex, geographically distributed supply chain. No single country reigns supreme; specialised firms around the world contribute to different parts of the supply chain. While cutting-edge fabrication plants (fabs) are concentrated in a few regions, other parts are scattered globally.\nAs miniaturisation nears its limits, value is migrating from shrinking transistors in the front-end of semiconductor manufacturing to maximising their efficiency through clever design. Design contributes a majority of the industry’s value, according to a 2021 BCG report.\nTake NVIDIA, the world’s most valuable chip company. They design chips but outsource manufacturing giants like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) handle the actual production. This “pure-play foundry” model empowers tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta to design their own chips without fabs – as “fabless” chipmakers.\n\nChipmaking starts with slicing ultra-pure silicon into wafers. These wafers are etched with intricate designs using cutting-edge photolithography equipment, commonly procured from the Dutch manufacturer ASML. Once etched, the chips are assembled and tested, with locations like China, Vietnam, and Penang playing a role. Finally, the packaged chips are integrated into circuit boards for everything from phones to smart sensors.\nWhile chip assembly (back-end) is traditionally seen as less valuable, innovations like 3D stacking are boosting its importance. Packaging-related innovations allow for more powerful chips despite miniaturisation limits. As a result, the future may see value more evenly distributed across all chipmaking stages, with each playing a crucial role in maximising performance."

    "text": "A Geopolitical Pivot Creates Opportunity\nDespite short-term weakness from a supply glut, the chip industry’s future looks bright. As of Q1 2024, microelectronics industry association SEMI reports positive trends in sales, inventories, and factory capacity. While demand recovery varies by sector, leaders see automotive and AI as 2024’s growth engines, with AI infrastructure (especially data centres) following closely. The sluggish consumer electronics market, particularly smartphones, is looking to on-device (‘edge’) AI, powered by neural processing units (NPUs), for a comeback.\nIn spite of the global chip slowdown, Penang’s electronics sector has soared. In 2021, foreign approved manufacturing investment skyrocketed to RM 74 billion, a tenfold increase from the past decade’s average (RM 6 billion), where 98.7% (2021) was attributed to the electrical and electronics (E&E) sector. This surge accompanies double-digit production growth (GDP) for Penang’s electronics industry in both 2021 (+16.5%) and 2022 (+21.8%).\nPenang, a leader in back-end processes since the 1970s, is a prime beneficiary of the electronics industry’s shift towards geographical diversification. KPMG’s 2024 survey reveals that 53% of firms plan to diversify their supply chains in the coming year. The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying 2021 chip shortage highlighted the need for stronger supply chains. Concerns about future disruptions, from extreme weather to tensions around Taiwan, further emphasise this need.\nThe shift is expedited by the US-China “chip war”, where the US has tried to limit China’s tech growth with export restrictions and the CHIPS Act, which funds US chip production but restricts recipients from expanding in China. Since then, construction of electronics-related manufacturing in the States has grown 15-fold, although slow grant disbursement and talent shortages threaten to slow US chip projects.\nOn the other hand, China has been heavily investing in its chip industry, aiming for self-sufficiency by subsidising domestic companies and recruiting foreign talent. While Chinese firms excel in mature chips, it is unclear how much the US has managed to slow China’s progress in advanced chip development."

    "text": "The National Semiconductor Strategy\nAmidst intensifying rivalry between these two great powers, Malaysia, with its neutral position in regards to US-China relations, is well-placed to accommodate both Western allies seeking to diversify supply chains as well as Chinese firms trying to dodge American sanctions. In launching the National Semiconductor Strategy, prime minister Anwar Ibrahim touted Malaysia as the “most neutral and non-aligned location for semiconductor production”, and in a interview with the Financial Times, he expressed Malaysia’s position to maintain “good stable relations with the US [while] looking at China as an important ally”.\nWhile Malaysian observers have celebrated the launch of the strategy, in reality Malaysia is playing catch-up to a heated global semiconductor subsidy race. Anwar’s May 2024 announcement comes a full year after the UK, a leading chip design economy, launched its semiconductor strategy, following local chip bosses’ threats to move out of the UK if a plan was not launched.\nThe strategy is ambitious, targeting each portion of the semiconductor supply chain. Talent has been identified as a critical factor for the success of the local semiconductor industry, with plans to increase semiconductor talent tenfold. While substantial, the RM 25 billion (USD 5.33 billion) allocated pales in comparison to other states’ spending on chips: equivalent to just 13 ASML extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines at RM1.9 billion each, as pointed out in an opinion piece by semiconductor employee Ooi Tze Howe. \n\nAs part of the Strategy, Putrajaya aspires to be at the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing across all stages of manufacturing. With the ballooning costs of building semiconductor fabs, Malaysia’s competitiveness in cutting-edge fabs is unclear, particularly as Malaysia competes against generous state subsidies targeting fab construction. Indeed, the PM’s address specifically mentions trailing-edge chips and power chips, which are less capital intensive to produce, for the first phase of the strategy.\nConsidering the high resource intensity of the fabrication process, expansion of the semiconductor industry requires responsible, forward-looking stewardship of environmental resources, in the face of the looming threat of climate change. By some estimates, an advanced fab consumes\n\nseveral million gallons of water daily2, equivalent to a small town, and\nas much as 100 megawatt-hours of electricity per hour, or around one-eight of peak energy demand on Penang Island, while\nproducing thousands of tonnes of chemical waste annually.\n\n2 Some semiconductor manufacturers have made great strides towards reducing their water use: Intel’s Penang plant for example returned and restored 89% of its water use in 2023, and some Intel sites actually return/restore more water than used (2023-24 Intel Corporate Responsibility Report).Alongside Malaysia’s bullish posture towards data centres, Malaysia must consider if it has the means to support the resource needs of its fab aspirations.\nOn the other hand, commentators have pointed out the potential of scaling up Malaysia’s chip design industry, although as a highly knowledge-intensive industry, there are substantial barriers to entry. Thus far, only one chip design company, Oppstar, is listed on the Malaysian stock market. As with chip fabrication, Malaysia competes with substantial public investments by countries with first-mover advantage at the design stage. \nIn line with these aspirations, Penang’s chief minister Chow Kon Yeow has announced plans for the Penang Silicon Design @5KM initiative, which includes facilities catered towards high-value activities—in particular chip design and research and development (R&D)—and talent development strategies3.\n3 Penang’s state-level talent development framework is outlined in Penang STEM Talent Blueprint: A Roadmap for Workforce Development (2024), available at https://penanginstitute.org/publications/reports-and-papers/penang-stem-talent-blueprint-a-roadmap-for-workforce-development/.What is certain is that multinationals will continue to drive Malaysia’s semiconductor industry. In the past, Penang’s backend ecosystem has created opportunities for local companies in automated equipment and services. Intel’s establishment of its first 3D packaging facility outside the US in Penang comes alongside the increased importance of advanced chip packaging, potentially raising the value of backend operations. This collaborative approach, combining homegrown talent with the expertise of global players, positions Penang for future success."

For a GBM modelling a single feature, the model may start off looking something like this3:\n\nThe idea behind gradient boosting is to adjust the model sequentially to ‘fix’ the errors.\n\nWhere the actual values are above \\(F_0\\), the model should be adjusted upwards;\nWhere the actual values are below \\(F_0\\), the model should be adjusted downwards;\n\nThe boosting approach to solving this problem is to fit a model to the errors \\(\\epsilon = y-F(\\textbf{x})\\) at every iteration. At every iteration, we add a model of the errors to fix the previous model’s mistakes.\n\nStated differently, the model at the first boosting stage is the sum of the initial model \\(F_0\\) and the model of the residuals \\(f_1\\):\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]Intuitively, the residuals \\(\\epsilon\\) indicate the direction in which the overall model should be nudged to get to the target value.\n\nGradient descent?\nIn practice, the residuals used to fit the learners are computed using the gradient of the loss function, and are also known as pseudoresiduals.\nIf we were to add the entirety of the model of the residuals \\(f_1\\):\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]\nthen it may not be necessary to train for further iterations, since \\(y=F_0(\\textbf{x})+\\epsilon\\)4. So we slow down training by adding only a fraction \\(\\eta\\) of the learner:\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+\\eta f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]\n\\(\\eta\\) is known as the learning rate. It’s also known as a shrinkage parameter, since it shrinks the contribution of each learner to the ensemble.\nOr more generally, for the \\(b\\)-th iteration:\n\\[F_b(\\textbf{x})=F_{b-1}(\\textbf{x})+\\eta f_b(\\textbf{x})\\]\nNotice how this parallels with gradient descent for neural networks, where the direction of adjustment for the \\(j\\)-th model parameter \\(\\theta_j\\) is guided by the sign of the gradient:\n\\[\\theta_{j} =\\theta_{j}-\\eta \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\theta_j}J(\\theta)\\]\nwhere \\(J(\\theta)\\) refers to the loss function.\nWith gradient boosting, the direction of the gradient is used to adjust the overall model directly instead of individual model parameters.\n\n\nHow many trees, then?\nIt follows that lowering the learning rate \\(\\eta\\) generally requires more learners to build an optimal model. By slowing the speed of adjustment, the learning algorithm is more likely to converge, but a large ensemble may be required for an optimal model5.\nAn approach to determining the number of learners required is known as early stopping. Additional learners are added until the point of diminishing returns, where there is no noticeable performance gain for adding new trees.\nSince the model is trained iteratively, it is possible to score the model at every iteration. The early_stopping_rounds argument in XGBoost checks the previous early_stopping_rounds for any improvement in the test score and trains the model for additional rounds only if improvements are observed.\nMake sure to use separate sets of data for determining early stopping rounds and evaluating models."

Monotonic constraints ensure that a specified relationship is either strictly increasing or decreasing. See https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/monotonic.html for details.\n\n\nFeature interaction constraints\nIn tree-based models, each additional level introduces interactions to the model.

The additive structure of GBMs makes it possible to restrict interactions captured in a model by limiting the features used in each iteration.\n\nExplainable Boosting Machines train on one feature at a time and incorporate automatic detection of interactions, such that the resulting model can be directly interpreted by summing up across all trees.\nXGBoost allows users to specify which feature interactions are permitted.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nFirst published on LinkedIn.\n\n\nIt’s curious why lots of Malaysians think that brain drain is a problem. We had a look at the numbers at work last year, and reality is a bit more nuanced.\n\nThe migration rate is 5.7%\nThe migration rate is the share of Malaysia-born persons who currently reside outside Malaysia. Malaysia’s population was 32.6 million in 2021, and with 1.85 million residing abroad, the migration rate is 5.7%.\nIt’s important to bear in mind that the numerator of the migration rate is a stock, not a flow. This context is often not provided in the media.\nIn simpler terms, we don’t have good numbers on who moves where and when. All we know is who is where at a given time.\n\n\nThe migration rate is above the global average\nIt’s commonly cited that Malaysia’s migration rate is almost double the global migration rate. However, our migration rate is not out of line with neighbouring countries.\nIn fact, Malaysia’s migration rate is neck-to-neck with Singapore.\n\n\n\nMore and more people are migrating abroad\nPerhaps - yes, the migration rate has risen from 5.6% (2010) to 5.7% (2020), but the rate of growth of the number of Malaysian-born persons abroad has slowed:\n\nSo yes, the number of emigrants may be rising, but at a decreasing (even plateauing) rate.\nIf we were to use the citizen population as the denominator instead, the migration rate would in fact decline from 6.34% (2015) to 6.25% (2020).\n\n\nBrain drain vs brain gain\nConcerns about brain drain ignore the realities of human capital in the 21st century, where people’s skills have become increasingly niche and may not be in demand in local markets.\nAs a developing economy, there may not be immediate demand for niche skillsets in Malaysia. In a globalised world, there’s no harm in Malaysians leaving the country to workplaces that are in need of their skillsets, and returning once demand for their skillsets has developed here, in what’s termed ‘brain gain’.\nIn fact, the observation that Singapore is by far the largest destination for Malaysian-born persons (rather than somewhere else across the world) suggests that Malaysians living abroad may not really want to leave for good.\n\nHowever, if remote working is here to stay, I suppose concerns may eventually shift from brain drain to, say, tax avoidance.\n\nCheck my work\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/explorers/migration-flows?tab=table&facet=none&Select+a+country=Malaysia&Outflow+or+Inflow=Emigrants%3A+Where+people+born+in+the+selected+country+moved+to&country=~MYS\nKNOMAD 2021 migration matrix\nMalaysia population"

The state’s strategic location, skilled workforce and favourable investment climate have attracted numerous multinational corporations to set up their operations here.\nAlthough Penang plays a vital role in the global electronics supply chain, a significant portion of the value creation happens elsewhere. Penang specialises in the assembly and testing of semiconductor chips, commonly known as outsourcing semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) services. While these have been perceived as a lower-value segment, they provide a strong foundation for future growth in the semiconductor industry, especially with the demand for advanced packaging solutions increasing.\nThe trend towards diversification and the increasing importance of backend processes create opportunities for locations with established ecosystems, such as Penang. Arizona’s success in attracting TSMC’s investment—due to an existing semiconductor ecosystem primarily built by Intel—shows the advantages of leveraging established infrastructure and a skilled workforce.4 Penang can similarly capitalise on its OSAT strengths to attract investment in related activities, potentially becoming a hub for advanced packaging and testing solutions."

Nationally, between January and September 2024, E&E imports surged 16.9% year-on-year, while export value dropped slightly by -1.5%.5 In contrast, September’s year-to-date value of Penang’s electronics exports grew by 4.6% year-on-year, while imports grew by 15.5% over the same period, resulting in total trade rising by 8.4%.\n5 E&E references Harmonised System (HS) code 85 for comparability with Penang-level data, which is only available at the two-digit level for the HS. MATRADE states 28.6% and 0.6% for imports and exports respectively in its September 2024 report, but it is unclear which commodity codes are used. Restricting the analysis to HS codes 8541 and 8542, we get 17.6% and -4.4% for imports and exports respectively.

Consequently, growth in Penang’s electronics trade between 2015 and 2024 has well surpassed 10% per annum.

The technological complexity and capital intensity required for leading-edge fabrication pose substantial challenges for newcomers.\nIntel, a long-time leader in semiconductor manufacturing, encountered substantial difficulties in transitioning to advanced nodes, illustrating the technological barriers even for established players.6 Fortunately, even if Penang does not rise to the pinnacle of the value chain, industry and geopolitical circumstances continue to offer a strong foundation for Penang’s job market—no doubt a contributor to Penang’s enviably low unemployment rate.\n6 Nikkei Asia, 2024.One way for Penang companies to upgrade their operations is through the championing of their local site leaders—however, it takes visionary leadership and long-term planning to build local capacity and convince top management that local sites are ready to move up the value chain. Further understanding of the internal decision-making processes of multinational companies (MNCs) could shed some light into developing strategies to encourage them to upgrade their operations in Penang.\nEven so, strong corporate leadership may not be sufficient. Typically, policies that induce “vulnerability shocks” which challenge firms’ status quos are the main driver of industrial upgrades in the developing world.7 Recognising and preparing for similar future disruptions can be crucial in facilitating industrial upgrades in Penang.\n7 https://www.sciencedirect.com/ science/article/abs/pii/ S0305750X173017298 The Penang Talent Prospects Survey (https://penanginstitute.org/wp- content/uploads/2023/07/Penang_Talent_Prospects_2023.pdf) finds that industry participants expect demand for engineering and technician talent to shift from technician-majority to engineer-majority from 2023 to 2026, although talent demand for each is projected to more than double.That being said, moving up the electronics value chain is not a silver bullet for economic development—a move to higher-value activities does not automatically lift all boats. As the industry in Penang becomes more technologically sophisticated, workforce demand may shift from technician- to engineer-dominant,8 potentially widening the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers, or even resulting in job losses for those whose skills are no longer in demand.\nPolicies that support worker training and reskilling can help mitigate job displacement and facilitate the transition to higher-value activities. Additionally, policies that promote fair labour practices and collective bargaining can ensure a more equitable distribution of the benefits."

    "text": "Trump 2.0: a stormy outlook\nA wave of decoupling from the Chinese supply chain among Western allies in the electronics industry, accelerated by the US CHIPS (“Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors”) and Science Act of 2022, is on track to create an even more geographically distributed supply chain. Experts have opined that the rise in US chip manufacturing will lead to greater demand for OSAT services abroad. Additionally, Penang has attracted chipmakers seeking to diversify their manufacturing footprint in what has been named the China Plus One strategy.9\n9 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-china-companies-move-manufacturing-facilities-semiconductors-trade-war-4282471The return of the Trump administration in 2025 creates substantial uncertainty for the global E&E industry. Of concern is the previous Trump administration’s aggressive posture towards the Chinese. Even though the US has a long-standing commitment to Taiwan’s security, the incoming administration’s capitulation towards authoritarians bodes poorly for Taiwan, an indispensable component of the global supply chain for leading-edge chips.\nThe only certainty will be a further breakdown in US policy coherence. It is baffling how the CHIPS Act’s aggressive measures to reshore chips manufacturing and stifle Chinese innovation is the encapsulation of Trump’s “America First” rhetoric. Yet, in October, Trump referred to the CHIPS Act as a “bad deal”,10 raising uncertainties about the future of the Act.11 Trump’s protectionist rhetoric must be considered together with the contrarianism that defines the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.\n10 https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/trump-likely-to-uphold-chips-act-despite-his-campaign-rhetoric-experts-say.html11 Experts have opined that a repeal of CHIPS is unlikely. House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed Trump’s position on CHIPS, then walked back on his comments, expressing a desire to “streamline” the Act instead of repealing it. (https://apnews.com/article/mike-johnson-chips-act-d5504f76d3aa0d5b401216f3592c9a09)12 There is also the question of tariffs’ impact on consumer tech products in the US, which were previously exempt from Chinese import tariffs. Reporting suggests the tech industry expects to be caught in a trade war. (https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/tech- industry-fears-china-will- retaliate-against-trumps- 60-tariffs/)13 Tax Foundation, 2024.More alarmingly, on the campaign trail, Trump floated the idea of raising import tariffs to unprecedented levels, in particular with China: 60% for Chinese goods, 10-20% for goods from the rest of the world.12 This proposal would bring back US import tariff rates unseen since the Great Depression. In 1930, the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which raised tariffs to their highest levels since the early 19th century, and is believed to have contributed to the severity of the Great Depression by reducing international trade.13\n\nIf Trump were to implement tariffs at the levels he has proposed, they would be comparable to Smoot-Hawley in magnitude—though the impact of Trump’s proposal for universal tariffs would be far more wide-ranging, affecting 10 times the value of trade impacted by the 2018 trade war. Experts expect these tariffs to raise inflation and unemployment alongside substantial uncertainties for US importers,14 increasing the risk of a US recession. Given the magnitude of the tariffs, China and other countries would likely be compelled to impose retaliatory tariffs against the US, reducing gains from trade across the world. Moreover, the accompanying appreciation in the dollar risks precipitating global financial instability.15\n14 https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/post/ tariffs-on-all-imports-would-create-chaos-for-business/15 https://www.intereconomics.eu/ contents/year/2024/ number/4/article/trump-s-2025-tariff-threats.html16 Ratan, 2024.17 For semiconductors specifically, even without Trump’s tariffs, 2025 is already set for a substantial widening of Malaysia’s tariff gap vis-a-vis China. Currently, China semiconductor imports are subject to 25% Section 301 tariffs, but with the four-year review of Section 301 recently finalised in September 2024, US tariffs for China semiconductor imports are set to rise to 50% in 2025, notwithstanding 10-year restrictions on expansion in China and other “countries of concern” imposed on the recipients of the CHIPS Act funding. (https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/89%20FR%2076581%20(September%2018%2C%202024).pdf;https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2024/05/16/united-states-tariff-hike-will-benefit-malaysia;https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/guardrails-chips-act-funding-restrict-investments-china-may-restrict)18 A Consumer Technology Association report attributes the 2021 surge in Malaysia’s semiconductor production to supply issues rather than US tariffs, since the 25% Section 301 US semiconductor tariffs were imposed already in August 2018. (https://www.wita.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CTA_Section-301-Tariff-Whitepaper.pdf)19 https://www.nber.org/digest/202204/how-us-china-trade-war-affected-rest-worldPenang has welcomed firms seeking to exploit tariff gaps— for instance the relocation of Chinese solar manufacturers to circumvent trade barriers.16 Therefore, there is some chance that Trump 2.0 may work in Penang’s favour.17 In fact, the ignition of the US-China trade war during the first Trump administration saw trade increase for “bystander” countries18, particularly those with a high degree of economic integration.19 Nevertheless, with Trump’s proposal affecting the rest of the world this time, there will be no bystanders.\nWhile protectionist measures like those implemented by the US could incentivise the return of some manufacturing to the US, Malaysia’s semiconductor industry has shown resilience in the face of such policies. However, beyond the anticipated tariff-induced slump in the US domestic demand, if US chips policy deepens across the supply chain beyond fabrication20—or, worse yet—if the CHIPS Act is repealed, demand for Penang’s OSAT services could decline, potentially leading to local job losses in the industry.\n20 While the focus of the CHIPS Act is on semiconductor manufacturing, CHIPS incentives also include packaging activities with an apparent focus on advanced packaging. It also includes funding that will be deployed to expand international packaging capacity through the ITSI (International Technology Security and Innovation) fund.

As a matter of fact, the global semiconductor industry faces an acute shortage of skilled workers, from technicians to specialised engineers. While initiatives like Penang’s STEM Talent Blueprint and Malaysia’s National Semiconductor Strategy address this challenge, competition for talent remains fierce. Continuous training and upskilling programmes are crucial to ensure that the local workforce meets the industry’s evolving demands. Collaborations with educational institutions—like Intel’s partnership with Arizona colleges21—can help create a pipeline of skilled workers.\n21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTcbUcRdaYg&t=690sWhile federal and state authorities have accurately identified human capital as the growth lever for the semiconductor industry, caution must be exercised to ensure it is done holistically. Amidst the E&E gold rush, policymakers must not lose sight of the broad spectrum of the sciences. A holistic STEM development strategy in Penang must go beyond electronics engineering. The STEAM movement—incorporating artistic skills into science education—is a reminder not to decouple creativity from the sciences, as problem-solving skills are key enablers for higher-value operations.\nIt is natural for policymakers to pursue STEM development to accommodate the needs of the E&E industry, but the responsibility goes both ways. The success of China’s “forced” technology transfer regime in jumpstarting its now-dominant electric vehicle industry calls into question the conventional wisdom of a straightforward role for investment liberalisation in spurring economic development.22 Although the practice is controversial, it may be worthwhile to explore mechanisms to encourage capital investments from talent-intensive sectors to contribute to the community’s talent development.\n22 An assessment of Chinese solar panel manufacturers’ relocation to Malaysia (primarily Penang), induced by trade barriers, casts doubt on the idea of broad benefits from FDI beyond local employment (https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Malaysia_Paper.pdf)"

On the one hand, the industry is poised for continued growth, driven by global semiconductor demand and Penang’s key role in the global supply chain. Penang has successfully attracted significant foreign investment in the E&E sector, particularly in 2021 and 2023. On the other hand, the industry faces uncertainties arising from its inordinate exposure to global trends and geopolitical tensions, such as the US-China “chip war” and the return of the Trump administration.\nPenang’s semiconductor future hinges on recognising the complexities of corporate decision-making and the potential pitfalls of focusing solely on moving up the value chain. While chip design and research and development (R&D) are attractive opportunities for industrial upgrading, to encourage higher-value operations, a keen understanding of the internal processes within MNCs goes hand-in-hand. Additionally, simply shifting towards higher-value activities may not guarantee widespread economic benefits and could even exacerbate social inequalities. Therefore, a nuanced approach is needed—one that considers the interplay of global trends, internal corporate dynamics and social equity—alongside strategies for talent development and technological advancement."

    "text": "The allure of private schools\nMalaysia boasts a relatively low private school enrollment rate compared to its Southeast Asian neighbours. However, a concerning trend threatens the long-held role of public education in fostering social cohesion.\nSince the ban on citizens attending international schools was relaxed in 20081, the share of secondary school-age children enrolling in private institutions has almost tripled from 3.4% (2002) to 9.4% (2021), while at the primary level, the rate has risen dramatically from just under 1% in 2002 to 6.3% (2021), even outpacing enrollment rates at the secondary level until recently.\n1 https://asia.nikkei.com/NAR/Articles/Failing-state-schools-prompt-parents-to-go-private\nPenang parents’ pivot towards private schools coincides with a surge in the popularity of private education nationally, spurring the recent proliferation of international schools in Penang. In Penang, public secondary school enrollment has declined by 19.2% over the past decade (2013 - 2023). Primary school enrollment decreased by 5.3%, comparable with a 6.2% decrease in Penang’s 5-14 population in the same period2. Concurrently, according to Ministry of Education reports, the number of international schools in Penang has risen from 8 to 12.\n2 According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) population estimates, Penang’s 5-14 citizen population decreased by 11% in the same period. Assuming the non-citizen population makes up a negligible portion of public school enrolment, the muted decrease in primary public school enrolment suggests that the citizen population may now be slightly more likely to attend public primary school. It is also important to note that Penang vernacular (primary) schools have seen double-digit declines in enrolment in the past decade (Chinese: -13%, Tamil: -11%; 2013-2023), while national primary schools have maintained their headcount.The reduction in public school enrolment is unlikely to indicate a significant pattern of dropouts from formal education in Penang. However, this may be a concern at the national level. UIS statistics indicate that one in 20 (4.7%, 2022) primary school-age children in Malaysia do not attend any school. In Penang, public school enrollment in Year One alone (20,843, 2023) equals 96% of children born in 2016 (21,781). In contrast, Malaysia’s 2023 Year One public school enrolment (447,876) was only 88% of children born in 2016 (508,203).\nThe faster pace of decline in public secondary school enrolment, relative to Penang’s demographic changes, suggests that the shift in preference for private education dominates at the secondary level, as opposed to the primary level. Penang’s national primary school graduates are over twice as likely not to attend public secondary school than the average Malaysian Year Six student. Almost one in five (17.8%) eligible primary school graduates in Penang did not enrol in a secondary public school in the subsequent year, versus 8.3% for Malaysia (2023).\n\nThe outsized presence of Chinese-medium private schools is especially noteworthy. Although enrollment (5,702, June 2023) is on par with international schools (5,010, June 2023), it is crucial to consider that independent Chinese schools cater solely to the secondary level. Enrolment in these schools is almost double secondary-level enrolment in international schools in Penang (2,695, June 2023). For comparison, international and independent Chinese schools’ enrollment at the secondary level is equivalent to 8.7% of secondary-level students enrolled in public schools in Penang (96,896, 2023).\nThe demand for international education is booming in Penang. Enrolment in international schools has grown at 5.2% annually (cumulative annual growth rate, CAGR) between 2013 and 2023, outpacing plateauing enrollment growth in Chinese private schools (2.3% CAGR). According to a Tenby Schools Penang representative, this surge is driven by parents’ desire for their children to develop strong English language skills and benefit from a broader curriculum that fosters independent learning. Interestingly, primary-level enrollment in international schools is catching up with secondary-level enrollment, even surpassing secondary enrollment for a brief period in 2021. Tenby Schools Penang confirms this observation of a rising influx of younger students.\n\nIt is essential to note the substantial role of the religious private education sector3. Between various privately-run religious education entities, including people’s religious schools, private religious schools (sekolah agama swasta), tahfiz schools and sekolah pondok, Penang registered 8,836 students across 92 institutions in 2023, well exceeding international schools.\n3 An overview of the religious private education sector is beyond the scope of this article. For a primer, refer to The Potential of Independent Religious Schools: A Case Study of Al-Amin (Deviyati, 2016) and Three things about: Malaysia’s (private/ state-funded) Islamic schools (https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2017/04/29/three-things-about-malaysias-private-state-funded-islamic-schools/1366345)."

Meanwhile, advocates for Chinese language education and Christian communities grapple with safeguarding their historical and culturally significant schools, established during a period of diverse educational approaches, in the face of a more centralised national education system.\nOn the other hand, private schools are mostly shielded from the contentious political debates that plague public education discussions in Malaysia. However, this creates a two-tiered system, potentially entrenching social and educational disparities.\n\nDifferent languages\nThe question of language has been a central theme in the evolution of Malaysia’s national education system. Although Malay is the main medium of instruction in public schools, science and maths education shifted towards English under the PPSMI policy during the Mahathir administration, and was subsequently reversed by the MBMMBI policy in 2010. The introduction of the Dual Language Programme (DLP) in 2016 provided some schools with the option to deliver science and maths in English, and is currently implemented in 2,501 schools across Malaysia8.\n8 https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/03/14/dlp-now-in-2501-schoolsHowever, a recent change adds a new layer of complexity. Starting in the 2024/25 academic year, students must demonstrate basic Malay language skills to enrol in DLP classes. Additionally, DLP schools need to meet overall Malay language performance standards and offer at least one class with science and maths taught in Malay or the mother tongue.\nThe latter requirement in particular has caused confusion and frustration, especially in schools with no interest in non-DLP classes. According to press reports9, Year One students in Kuala Lumpur had to undergo extensive assessments in multiple languages and subjects to qualify for DLP enrollment, although the Ministry has clarified that it had not prescribed assessments to determine DLP eligibility.\n9 https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/05/04/dlp-ball-back-in-schools-court10 Dewan Rakyat Hansard, 27th November 2023, p.103.

Representatives of the Infant Jesus Sisters (IJS)12, owner of the Convent schools, said they plan to convert these schools to private schools, and in 202013, ACE Edventure announced plans to set up a private international school on the grounds of Convent Light Street. Likewise, Methodist College Kuala Lumpur (MCKL) has established its Pykett campus on the grounds of SK Pykett Methodist, a 20-minute drive from the new Wesley Methodist (International) School campus.\n11 https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2023/04/01/tears-over-closing-of-two-secondary-convent-schools12 See The Devoted Pioneers of Girls’ Education in Malaya in the January 2016 issue for background on the IJS. 13 https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2023/01/15/new-plans-for-convent-school14 Tze , Danny, Ken Wong, and Vivien Wong. “Chinese Education in a Multiethnic Society: Malaysia Experience.” The Cultural Legacies of Chinese Schools in Singapore and Malaysia, edited by Cheun Hoe Yow and Jingyi Qu, Routledge, 1 Mar. 2021.15 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-vernacular-schools-education-chinese-tamil-malay-national-unity-427727616 https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/03/16/dong-zong-urges-unity-govt-to-recognise-uec#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20UEC%20is%20yet,%3E17 https://www.dongzong.my/v3/en/latest-news-2/notice-statement/1175-2022-78.htmlThese closures follow in the footsteps of independent Chinese schools, which diverged from the national system in the wake of the 1961 Education Act14.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nFirst published in Penang Monthly (September 2023).\nWANTAN MEE IS a classic dish in Penang. Simple and tasty, it is a safe pick if you are unsure of what to order when eating out. It is usually served with fried or boiled dumplings, or a mix of both. What differs among vendors are also how many dumplings are included in the dish; some “dumplings” are also nothing more than fried dough skin.\nPenang hawker food gives the French a run for their money, and hawkers continue to beat expectations about how small portions can be. Penangites are penny-wise regarding hawker food, and the hawkers seem to have recognised this. Extraordinarily, the Butterworth Art Walk organised a RM2 mini-food festival, allowing patrons to savour “smaller portions of hawker food at lower prices”1.\nHock Khoon from Bukit Mertajam laments how Curry Mee used to come with many cockles and side ingredients. “Now it has shrunk a lot. They compensate with more noodles! Some don’t even add cuttlefish.” He also observes how much beef portions have decreased at a major Japanese food outlet in Penang, even as its prices have increased.\nThis phenomenon, where businesses maintain pricing while reducing the quantity or size of their products, is known as shrinkflation. Named by the Norwegian Language Council as the Word of the Year in 2022 (Krympflasjon in Norwegian), the word was first used in 2015 in its current meaning by economist, Pippa Malmgren. A portmanteau of the words “shrink” and “inflation”, shrinkflation has been referred to in the past as package downsizing, product downsizing and content reduction.\nAs of June 2023, the food component of Penang’s consumer price index (CPI) has risen by 12.9% since early 2020. In 2022 alone, food prices increased by 6% year-on-year, contributing to 1.8% of Penang’s inflation for the year, up from 0.3% in 2021. Prices for milk, cheese and eggs rose by 11% year-on-year in 2022 (2021: 2.6%), while meat prices increased by 10.5% (2021: 1%). As of now, food price inflation remains elevated across the world amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, coupled with erratic weather patterns caused by a dangerous combination of climate change and El Nino. The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) notes that lower dam levels in northern Peninsular Malaysia threaten to lower rice yields, while the National Water Service Commission (SPAN) has set up an El Nino “war room” to monitor dam levels.\nDifferent parts of the world have been experiencing shrinkflation differently. In Nigeria, Domino’s launched a “smallie” pizza with just four slices. In Europe, Bloomberg reports that Hamburg’s consumer protection office received three to five times more than the usual number of complaints regarding shrinking product sizes.

    "text": "Why Does This Work?\nTo many economists, the idea that the economic man (homo economicus) would fall prey to the shrinkflation trick is preposterous. If consumers are rational, should they not respond to a traditional price increase like they would to a price increase disguised as smaller packaging? On the contrary, the market research firm, Nielsen2, claims that consumers respond half as much to a change in prices via downsizing versus a raw price increase, and evidence suggests that shrinkflation does fool consumers.\nSome theorise that firms exploit consumers’ inattention, hoping that consumers will not notice the change in quantity at the same price, or perhaps firms try to avoid angering customers by raising prices. In “Does Peter Piper Pick a Package of Pepper Inattentively?” 3, Ian Meeker finds that US consumers did not reduce their purchases in response to the shrinkflation of black pepper. Conversely, in Japan, evidence from store scanner data4 suggests that consumers there do respond to shrinking product sizes.\nFor certain types of businesses, shrinkflation can be explained by using a pricing strategy known as quantum pricing, where there are significant gaps between prices, and the same prices are used across different types of products over time. Retailers design their products to fit a certain price, which explains why quality (and/or quantity) reduces over time. Aparicio and Rigobon 5 find that large retailers, notably Apple, Zara, H&M, Ikea and Uniqlo, follow this strategy.\n\n\n\nMedian price by premise type, Penang (January 2022 to July 2023).

    "text": "What Can We Do?\nGiven how hard it is to track shrinkflation, consumers have taken matters into their own hands in some parts of the world. A Japanese consumer, Masayuki Iwasa, created a website to track shrinkflation — www.neage.jp — which monitors 400 goods and services. In the US, Edgar Dworsky, founder of consumer advocacy site mouseprint.org, has been cited in the New York Times as the only person documenting shrinkflation in the US.\nThe Malaysian Minister of Economy, Rafizi Ramli, has encouraged consumers to leverage Department of Statistics’ (DOSM) data to compare price differences across premises using the KitaJaga app. However, the items covered are fairly limited and may not reflect changing consumer preferences. This raises the question of whether or not the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on these data, provides a good view of general price changes."

    "text": "If you’re one of the 16.5% of employees who pay taxes in Malaysia you may be familiar with the many ways by which you can reduce your tax burden: tax reliefs. From purchases of computers to EPF contributions, there’s so many incentives that the government provides for you to save money, or even get some cash back in the process.\nBut wait a minute, you say. “I’m part of the 16%? The median income in Malaysia was RM5,873 a month in 20191, and I’m barely there.” But well, most of you aren’t your own household. And if you’re a single-earner household, your median income turns out to be just RM2,988 (2019), well below the taxable threshold of around RM3,000 a month. The Salaries and Wages Report, which provides more frequent updates on wage trends, indicates a median income of RM2,250 in 2021.\nSo yeah, if you’re familiar with Borang BE pat yourself on the back. You’re T20, you’ve made it as part of the socioeconomic elite.\nTax rebates are a great way for the government to claim to ‘fix’ problems without actually putting their money where their mouth is. There’s no real expense, just revenue forgone. But in truth, like a reverse Robin Hood, tax rebates steal from the poor to subsidise tax bills for the rich. So when a bunch of experts suggested in the media that tax rebates be used to encourage people to top up their EPF savings, I was rather unhappy.\nTo see why, let’s take a middle-of-the-road employee (‘Person A’) from a T20 household. In 2019, the median income per capita in a T20 household was RM3,854, or RM 46,248 a year2. For comparison, let’s take an individual (‘Person B’) that earns double that, say RM92,496. For the year of assessment 2022, Person A falls under the 8% tax bracket, whereas Person B falls under the 21% tax bracket. Ignoring all applicable tax reliefs, their tax payable would be as follows:\nSuppose that both Person A and B enjoy RM1,000 tax relief on top of the standard RM9,000 tax relief (for existing? idk). This reduces chargable income for each of these persons by RM10,000. However, for Person A, tax payable reduces by 800 (RM10,000 \\(\\times\\) 8%), while for Person B tax payable reduces by RM2,100. This means the government has forgone 2.6 times more tax revenue for the richer Person B than for Person A, and makes tax deductions highly regressive: the rich benefit more than the poor.\nPerhaps you object: Person B’s income means he contributes more to society, so he deserves additional relief proportionate to his contribution. Even by that logic, the government has forgone proportionately more revenue than Person B has earned.\nNot to mention that the tax relief system is the bane of ratepayers’ existence: you are required to keep records for several years. Some of us approach the tax authorities for voluntary audits in fear of getting in trouble some point in the future if we’ve misunderstood the tax code.\nNow, there may be a place for tax relief if the intention is to incentivise the rich to do certain pro-social things, for instance engage in risky investments to spur innovation, or even to purchase insurance, where their purchase of insurance could diversify risk pools and contribute to lower premiums. But it would be a lot more equitable to subsidise these behaviours directly. Insurance vouchers, for instance. Or topping up EPF contributions to a minimum, in the style of a negative income tax.\nIf we expanded relief for voluntary contribution to the EPF, only the well-off and financially sound can afford to contribute voluntarily to the EPF at an amount significant enough to make a dent on their tax bill3. Not to lose sight of the fact that while we lobby the government to lower our tax bills, the median savings of EPF members has halved to RM8,100 in 2022 from RM16,600 pre-Covid.\nWe need a real conversation about how to fund social security moving forward, lest retirement means poverty for the aging masses."

I wondered if linear models can work for prediction problems with binary response variables, since there may be cases where the latent probability is linearly related to the features.\nSo I thought I’d do a little benchmark between different link functions for regression-based classifiers for the Titanic problem, based on the tidymodels packages.\n\nlibrary(vroom)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(rsample)\nlibrary(recipes)  \nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(broom) \nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(yardstick)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nvroom(here(\"data\", \"train.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names() -&gt; titanic_train\nvroom(here(\"data\", \"train.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names() -&gt; titanic_testing\n\nPreprocessing steps are taken from Megan Risdal’s R kernel on Kaggle, Exploring the Titanic Dataset, with the major change being that I use bagging imputation instead of MICE imputation for the Age column.\n\nrecipe(titanic_train) %&gt;% \n  step_mutate(survived = survived, role = \"outcome\") %&gt;% \n  update_role(pclass, age, sib_sp, parch, fare, \n              new_role = \"predictor\") %&gt;% \n  step_mutate(embarked = as.factor(embarked), \n         sex = as.factor(sex), \n         fsize = parch + sib_sp + 1, \n         title = gsub('(.*,)|\\\\s|(\\\\..*)', \"\", name),\n         title = str_trim(title), \n         fsize_d = case_when(\n           fsize == 1 ~ \"singleton\", \n           fsize &lt; 5 & fsize &gt; 1 ~ \"small\",\n           fsize &gt; 4 ~ \"large\"\n         ), \n         role = \"predictor\") %&gt;% \n  step_impute_bag(age, \n                 impute_with = imp_vars(-passenger_id, \n                                        -name, \n                                        -ticket,\n                                        -cabin,\n                                        -survived)) %&gt;% \n  step_unknown(title) %&gt;% \n  step_mutate(title = ifelse(is.na(title), \"unknown\", title)) %&gt;% \n  step_mutate(child = as.factor(age &lt; 18),\n              mother = sex == \"female\" & parch &gt; 0 & age &gt; 18 & title == \"Miss\", \n              role = \"predictor\")  %&gt;% \n  step_other(title, threshold = .05) -&gt; rec\n\ntrained_rec &lt;- prep(rec, training = titanic_train)\ntitanic_training &lt;- bake(trained_rec, new_data = titanic_train)\ntitanic_testing &lt;- bake(trained_rec, new_data = titanic_testing)\n\nI then fit linear and non-linear models:\n\nformula &lt;- survived ~ pclass + sex + age + sib_sp + parch +\n     fare + embarked + as.factor(title) + fsize_d + child + mother\n     \nlm(formula, data = titanic_training) -&gt; reg\n\nglm(formula, \n   data = titanic_training, family = \"binomial\") -&gt; log_reg\n\nglm(formula, \n   data = titanic_training, \n   family = binomial(link = \"probit\")) -&gt; prob_reg\n   \nglm(formula, \n   data = titanic_training, \n   family = binomial(link = \"cauchit\")) -&gt; cauch_reg\n\nThese classifiers all have a common theme - they use an underlying regression model to estimate probabilities. The weakness of using a linear model for classification problems is that the probabilities can be less than 0 or more than 1, which defies the rules of probability. Len Kiefer explores trimmed OLS for estimating effect sizes, where we eliminate observations where the predicted probabilities are less than 0 or more than 1 first, then re-estimate OLS. The code for trimmed OLS are as follows:\n\n# trimmed OLS\nreg %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  filter(.fitted &lt; 0 | .fitted &gt; 1) -&gt; out_of_bounds\n\ntitanic_training %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(var = '.rownames') %&gt;% \n  anti_join(out_of_bounds, \n            by = \".rownames\") %$%\n  lm(formula, data = .) -&gt; trimmed_ols\n\nAnd now time to evaluate. While the OLS models don’t perform as well here, the model using the Cauchit link function provides the highest accuracy score:\n\neval &lt;- function(model, newdata = titanic_testing, type.predict = NULL) {\n  multi_metric &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, kap)\n  model %&gt;% \n    augment(newdata = newdata, \n            type.predict = type.predict) %&gt;% \n    mutate(pred_class = as.integer(.fitted &gt; .5)) %&gt;% \n    multi_metric(as.factor(survived), estimate = as.factor(pred_class))\n}\n\nbind_rows(list(eval(reg),\n               eval(trimmed_ols),\n               eval(log_reg, type.predict = \"response\"),\n               eval(prob_reg, type.predict = \"response\"),\n               eval(cauch_reg, type.predict = \"response\")\n               )) %&gt;% \n  mutate(model = rep(c(\"OLS\", \"trimmed OLS\", \"logit\", \"probit\", \"cauchit\"), \n                     each = 2)) %&gt;% \n  select(model, .metric, .estimator, .estimate) %&gt;% \n  arrange(.metric, desc(.estimate))\n\nWarning in predict.lm(x, newdata = newdata, na.action = na.pass, ...):\nprediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading\n\nWarning in predict.lm(x, newdata = newdata, na.action = na.pass, ...):\nprediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading\n\n\nWarning in predict.lm(object, newdata, se.fit, scale = 1, type = if (type == :\nprediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading\n\nWarning in predict.lm(object, newdata, se.fit, scale = 1, type = if (type == :\nprediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading\n\nWarning in predict.lm(object, newdata, se.fit, scale = 1, type = if (type == :\nprediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   model       .metric  .estimator .estimate\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 cauchit     accuracy binary         0.836\n 2 logit       accuracy binary         0.827\n 3 probit      accuracy binary         0.826\n 4 OLS         accuracy binary         0.825\n 5 trimmed OLS accuracy binary         0.823\n 6 cauchit     kap      binary         0.644\n 7 logit       kap      binary         0.630\n 8 probit      kap      binary         0.628\n 9 OLS         kap      binary         0.625\n10 trimmed OLS kap      binary         0.623\n\n\nLooks like the cauchit model has the highest accuracy, and OLS isn’t too far behind the logit. But why does the cauchit link function perform better?\n\nThe “cauchit” model is attractive when observed responses exhibit a few surprising values, observations for which the linear predictor is large in absolute value indicating that the outcome is almost certain, and yet the linear predictor is wrong. (http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/links/links.pdf)\n\nI’m having trouble braining this paragraph, but it sounds like the cauchit is robust to large values of the predictors. Is this the case? For simplicity I check the fitted values from the linear model:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nreg %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeems to be a few extreme cases, but not too harsh."

    "text": "In short, we do cross-validation to pick the right model. But what does that mean for our ‘final model’?\nLet’s take a step back and motivate the train-test split approach (otherwise known as the evaluation set approach). Like cross-validation, we perform the evaluation set approach because we want to have some idea of how our model performs in the real world.\n\nThe evaluation set approach\nA simple way to achieve this is to split our data so that the model is *trained* on one part of the data, and *evaluated* on the other part (‘holdout’). This is what we see at the start of most machine learning courses:\n\n\n\nevaluation set approach\n\n\nIn Python, this is what we do when we call train_test_split() from sklearn:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 0.3)\nfor R users, using the tidymodels infrastructure, rsample can be used to split training and holdout sets:\nlibrary(rsample) \n\ncar_split &lt;- initial_split(mtcars)\ntrain_data &lt;- training(car_split)\ntest_data &lt;- testing(car_split)\n\n\nTraining on the evaluation set\nUnfortunately for us, in practice, we use the holdout set a lot more than once. Today’s data scientist is spoiled for choice when it comes to algorithms: for gradient boosting alone, you have XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting, gbm etc., not to mention the numerous hyperparameters you have for any one algorithm. If you use the holdout set to guide your choice of hyperparameters, you are bound to overfit on your holdout set.\nThe no-free-lunch theorem further complicates this problem. Loosely speaking, the no-free-lunch theorem asserts that there is no One True Algorithm that has superior performance across all use cases. Given the above, the data scientist would have to test the algorithm multiple times to see which works best. With the evaluation set approach, this amounts to training on the holdout set.\n\n\nAnother holdout set\nIf you put this question up to the deep learning folks, they’ll provide you a seemingly simple solution: create two holdout sets. Pick the correct model on Holdout 1 (‘validation’), then evaluate the final model on Holdout 2 (‘holdout’):\n\n\n\ntrain, validation, holdout\n\n\nThis may not be ideal sometimes because:\n1. data is often limited: there may not be enough data for two holdout sets. Moreover, in cases where observations are time-sensitive, a TVH approach could reduce the generalizability of the chosen model if the time period of the shrinked training set is less relevant to the problem at hand.\n2. Additionally, depending on the observations picked in validation/holdout, test error can be highly variable (see ISLR for details).\n\n\nK-fold cross-validation\nAnd so we move on to cross-validation, in hopes that we can get around this limited-data problem. This diagram may be familiar to some of you:\n\n\n\n5-fold cross-validation\n\n\nIn (k-fold) cross-validation, we try to get at some semblance of generalization performance by resampling the development data. Slicing the development data into 5 folds, we train the data on 4 folds, and validate the resulting model on the remaining fold. We repeat this for each permutation of folds, and then average the validation score to obtain the cross-validated score.\n\n\nWhich is the final model?\nWhile performing cross-validation, we have trained K models to evaluate our training procedure. Which should be the final model?\nNone of the above! The purpose of cross-validation is merely to pick the correct procedure for fitting a model. Whether it be the algorithm or the hyperparameter search space, the purpose of cross-validation is to know what procedure works best for your data. The same procedure can be reused to re-fit the model on new data, and that should make up your final model.\n\nThe purpose of cross-validation is model checking, not model building (StackExchange)\n\nIn fact, once you’re done with cross-validation and picked your final model, you can, and should, re-train your model-building procedure on all the data you have. There is no reason to drop the holdout set once the optimal procedure has been selected."

No single model from the cross-validation process should actually be used as your final model1; cross-validation is merely a way to evaluate how well your modeling process works on repeated samples of your data, to get a better sense of how well your modeling choice works in the real world.\nIf you’re comparing estimator-to-estimator without tuning much, you’re at pretty low risk of overestimating model performance from model selection, so long as you don’t peek at your test set. Suppose I had three simple models:\ndict(zip(\n  [\"GaussianNB\", \"LogisticRegression\", \"RandomForestClassifier\"], \n  [round(i, 3) for i in [nb_scores.mean(), lr_scores.mean(), rf_scores.mean()]]\n))\n\n{'GaussianNB': 0.939, 'LogisticRegression': 0.947, 'RandomForestClassifier': 0.953}\nFrom the scores above, it seems that RandomForestClassifier should perform best out-of-sample."

    "text": "What about hyperparameter tuning?\nI specifically chose these three estimators because they require minimal tuning. However, modern gradient boosting frameworks such as LightGBM and XGBoost have a lot of hyperparameters to choose from, and rarely do modellers have ways to guide hyperparameter choices.\nTaking elastic net as an example, where the regularization term is a mix of L1 and L2 penalties:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big( y^{(i)} - \\hat{y}^{(i)}  \\big)^2 + \\lambda_1 \\sum^{m}_{j=1} w_{j}^2+ \\lambda_2 \\sum^{m}_{j=1} |w_j|\n\\] which is sometimes restated to establish a ‘mixing parameter’ \\(\\alpha\\) (e.g. glmnet):\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big( y^{(i)} - \\hat{y}^{(i)}  \\big)^2 + \\lambda\\left[ \\frac {1-\\alpha}{2}\\sum^{m}_{j=1} w_{j}^2+\\alpha \\sum^{m}_{j=1} |w_j|\\right]\n\\]\nThe choice between L1 and L2 regularization can be guided by our hypotheses of how the feature set affects the target. For instance, if many features do not affect the target, a higher mix of L1 penalty may be more appropriate, whereas if each feature contributes a little to the target, the L2 penalty would be more appropriate. However, it is not clear how to pick the regularization term \\(\\lambda\\)."

While I tested this on only two groups of students, generally this example made sense, and is a great motivation to use the tidyverse.\nFor me, starting out with skimming over base basics is probably the ideal approach. At the least, cover basic atomic vectors and lists. It’d be difficult to show how to use functions operating on vectors in mutate() (and maybe the .data pronoun) with limited experience in base otherwise.\nAs we designed the course, we discovered that dplyr had convenient database backends that connect to SQL and Spark, and this was an added motivation for learning dplyr syntax well."

However I concede most of the progress in safety is with purrr and less so in dplyr (my impression).\n\nNo side-effects A key principle in the design of dplyr functions is that the function should not affect the original data frame. We designed our material in Jupyter Notebooks, where out-of-order execution was an issue. In the context of material designed in Jupyter Notebooks, a no-side-effects workflow is advantageous, since if you run cells out of order, you could potentially get different results. This is less of a problem in R Markdown because the user is encouraged to knit the document. pandas seems to be headed in a similar direction, deprecating the inplace = True argument altogether and encouraging the use of method chaining.\nsafer functions: The tidyverse includes type-safe versions of base functions such as if_else()vs. ifelse() and especially type-safe functional programming (purrr::map() functions vs. sapply() with its set of simplification rules)."

While I’m not familiar with using them, they’ve been around for a while.\nPipes, combined with dplyr verbs, provide a SQL-like logic to your code. In R for Data Science, the authors compare\nx(y(z(a)))\na %&gt;% z() %&gt;% y() %&gt;% x()\nwhere the first example is less human-readable, since it doesn’t follow the sequence of operations performed.\nPandas method chaining uses a similar workflow. I’m so used to using dplyr now, the first thing I look up before doing a data analysis project on tabular data in Python is the corresponding methods in pandas for the dplyr verbs. While I’m less familiar with the pandas methods, using them in conjunction with method chaining make for much more readable code, and using them is a priority for me if I’m doing extensive analysis in pandas.\nI’m not sure if pipes are easy to teach for most audiences given my limited experience, but they are critical to teaching in the tidyverse imo. It’s worked for me so far, but students often forget about the first argument."

For learners, this generally means learning a few functions allows you to reuse that knowledge with other functions with relative ease. tidyverse functions and packages offer consistent arguments across functions and packages, e.g. readr, readxl.\nThe biggest common denominator across the tidyverse is the data-first paradigm. An example how this helps is how it may be easier to teach functional programming in purrr compared to base R, since the multivariate versions of the apply functions contain the data within the ellipsis argument, which is the last argument, versus with lapply()/sapply() where the data is the first argument.\nThe tidyverse is designed as a grammar, or perhaps a way to speak about the operations you’re running. dplyr is the tidyverse’s grammar for manipulating tabular data encapsulated in 6 verbs and their variants, whereas ggplot2 is the tidyverse’s grammar for constructing charts.\nWithin the tidyverse grammar, every function is a verb. I particularly like the classification of the join verbs as mutating and filtering joins. It’s a useful heuristic for me to decide which join to use."

The argument defines the order of the factor levels before the user manipulates them, and the user is unaware of the order of the factor levels.

However, I never understood reprex well enough to file a good bug when it happened. )\nWe’ve been bitten by the ellipsis (...) argument in functions such as mean().

All the time.\nAnd don’t even get me started with tidyeval …\n\nMy teaching philosophy is to teach people to work with data efficiently with good data analysis workflows, not to become package authors (although that’d be nice!). I find that dplyr helps me think about my analysis faster. I don’t deal with datasets so big that I really care how long my code takes to run, so long as I do it right.

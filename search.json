We’re making good progress in power (and somehow the residential sector?) but transport is looking bad, whether ground or air.\nI’m no carbon analyst so I’m not sure what to do with the data, but I notice some interesting seasonality: across the world, emissions spike during the work week, but decline during weekends.\n\nMore interestingly, for ground transport, emissions consistently increase year-on-year during weekdays, and consistently decrease year-on-year during weekends:\n\nOkay, not really so for the world, but have a look at the US and the EU:\n\n\nand in case this was a fluke, I plotted the data by day of week:\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\ncarbon &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"carbonmonitor-global_datas_2023-08-31.csv\"), \n                   col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = \"%d/%m/%Y\")))\n\ncarbon_plus1 &lt;- carbon |&gt; mutate(date = date + lubridate::years(1))\n\ncarbon |&gt;\n  left_join(carbon_plus1 |&gt; select(-timestamp),\n            by = c(\"country\", \"date\", \"sector\")) |&gt;\n  drop_na(value.y) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    diff = value.x - value.y,\n    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1),\n    reduce = diff &lt; 0\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(year(date) == 2023, sector == \"Ground Transport\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, fill = reduce)) + geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(country), ncol = 3) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"\", y = \"\", \n    title = \"Ground transport emissions have risen during workdays \\nbut not the weekends\", \n    subtitle = \"Days with year-on-year decline in CO2 emissions by day of week\\nGround transport, Jan-Jul 2023\",\n    caption = \"Data from Carbon Monitor\") + \n  scale_fill_hc(limits = c(TRUE, FALSE)) + \n  theme_hc(style = \"darkunica\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"#cbcbcd\")) + guides(fill = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s nice to see weekend emissions fall somewhat: perhaps rising EV adoption is finally having an effect? As for consistently higher weekday emissions, I think it may be reflective of the reversal of flexible work arrangements to in-person work in spite of the significant health risks that continue to be posed by Covid-19, and it looks like there are significant climate costs associated with this unfortunate phenomena which more than offset the significant progress that has been made in decarbonising our energy sources."

    "text": "Not the post-Covid you’re thinking of\nWhile the public health emergency may have sunset, what has not is how 2020 marked a pivotal turning point in the science of disease transmission. Concerns about the air extend to more than just covid. Every pathogen that can transmit through air droplets is implicated, including rapidly spreading pathogens like measles and future novel airborne pathogens.\nEarly on in the pandemic, aerosol engineer Lindsey Marr wondered why a January 2020 article in the New York Times communicated that coronaviruses travelled shorter distances than viruses like measles, when her prior work on the flu virus suggested that SARS-Cov2 should be treated like any other airborne pollutant. Subsequent research about airborne transmission provided an explanation for bizarre superspreader events that couldn’t be explained by the widely accepted idea that surface transmission was the dominant route for transmission of diseases like covid-19, such as how covid-19 could spread across a room despite the then-accepted idea that airborne droplets travel no more than 2 metres.\n\nThe simple implication of the science of airborne pathogens tells us is that in a ‘post-Covid’ society, the air must be cleaned Unlike vaccines, cleaning the air is a variant-proof solution. Moreover, there are clear co-benefits of cleaning the air: a worldwide study reveals that short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contributes to roughly 1 million premature deaths annually. I am fortunate to be in Asian society where people have generally fallen in line with the use of high-quality masks even-as vital protection against disease, but it’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll last.\nNo thanks to incoherent public health messaging, societal norms do not reflect any understanding of the airborne route of disease transmission, from masks off for photos to indoor meals, and now with everyone ‘forgetting’ Covid-19, masks off altogether. At the height of the pandemic, the WHO and other public health agencies have consistently failed to acknowledge the prominence of the airborne route for transmission of SARS-Cov2. Up until very recently, local and international health agencies have consistently placed recommendations for hand hygiene above air hygiene measures in public health communication.\nTo the credit of the public health authorities, there has been a quiet shift in their position on the importance of cleaning indoor air. The new CDC recommendations stress the importance of air filtration and ventilation, and as early as 2021 Malaysia’s DOSH has issued air quality guidelines for commercial and residential settings. Yet thanks to public health authorities dragging their feet on acknowledging the science at the height of the pandemic, people have abdicated their responsibilities to mitigate airborne infection altogether, resulting in fundamentally unsafe public spaces. Consequently, health authorities in the US have watered down recommendations to align with what society can accept, even when the science dictates otherwise.\nEven though novel solutions such as UV-C and C-R boxes have been developed to complement HEPA filters and other solutions, the general public has been hoodwinked into thinking that nothing can and should be done to reduce disease transmission."

    "text": "Multi-system consequences\nThe pandemic thus far has been devastating to humanity. The Economist estimated the toll of the pandemic to be 35mil up to March 2024, just over Malaysia’s total population. Estimates of life expectancy suggest that Covid-19 has resulted in a loss of life expectancy at birth of 1.6 years, the largest drop since the Second World War. The costs of the pandemic, however, stretch far beyond mortality. The narrow framing of the health consequences of Covid-19 in terms of hospitalisations and deaths has led policymakers to ignore the chronic phase of Covid disease, colloquially known as Long Covid.\nLong Covid parallels Nassim Taleb’s description of ‘black-swan events’: low-likelihood, high-impact situations that are not often incorporated in people’s risk calculus. However, absent mitigation, the chances of contracting Long Covid would certainly not qualify as a black swan event. Estimates of the incidence of long-term complications from Covid infection range from 10-50% per infection. Moreover, Covid-19 isn’t subject to the same seasonality as the flu, with people contracting 2-3 infections a year.\n\n\nMuch has been documented about the consequences suffered by Long Covid patients, some of them who may have contracted Covid despite not exhibiting symptoms. There is no known cure for the disease. Some experts describe Covid as “not a disease of the lungs at all” but rather a “vascular and neurologic infection”. Moreover, the cognitive consequences of Long Covid are striking, equivalent to 10 years of aging. It is bizarre that Covid-19 isn’t treated as a serious occupational hazard. Rather, the consequences are so dire and rampant, a Californian court opined that were it to be treated as the occupational hazard that it is, the court would be brought to a standstill. Health issues that have classically been understood as non-communicable diseases are now literally airborne, yet the consequences of that have barely registered among policymakers.\nDavid Cutler published estimates of the economic cost of Long Covid at 3.7 trillion USD, or 17% of 2019 US GDP. In an online forum organised by a US-based insurer, he expressed that the magnitude of the problem is such that there is no amount of investment towards preventing and curing Long Covid that would not be worth it. Young people stand to lose the most from Long Covid with more life-years, children are not spared, with estimates suggesting some 5.8 million children in the US suffer from Long Covid."

    "text": "Increased threat level\nVaccines play a vital role in reducing the incidence of Covid-19 infection, severe disease and death. however they do not prevent infection completely. Moreover, considering the rapid evolution of covid-19 and especially the lack of available updated vaccines in our part of the world, calling for covid-19 precautions to be lifted is beyond premature. It has been established that vaccine-induced immunity to Covid-19 drops sharply in less than a year, and it should be clear that vaccine-acquired immunity is much safer than infection-acquired immunity.\nSome reassure us that we are not in 2021. We certainly are not: vaccines have not kept pace with the rapid mutation of Sars-Cov2. Malaysia has only had access to vaccines based on the 2020 strain of the virus thus far. Availability of current vaccines is limited.\nDespite this, society has been lulled into a false sense of security powered by groupthink. But groupthink logic is counterproductive in an active pandemic: when less people take precautions that reduce the risk for other people, the higher the risk for everyone else. Complacency about airborne pathogens is widespread amid the complete abdication of airborne disease mitigations. Generations to come will suffer for public intellectuals and politicians’ willful ignorance to avoid footing the costs of the practical and sensible normalisation of air filtration and ventilation measures."

    "text": "The WFH no-brainer\nDespite the established science on airborne disease transmission, employers insist that employees infect each other with any variety of airborne pathogen anywhere from 3 to 5 days a week, on top of denying medical leave for Covid. To add insult to injury, thought leaders continue to normalise in-person, unmasked superspreader events, accelerating the spread and mutations of and beyond covid-19, without regard for how in-person events exclude geographically distinct communities from vital policy conversations.\nRTO in an active pandemic is a marker of the devaluation of knowledge work: knowledge workers are being infantalised when employers tell them that they have to come in the office to be productive. It is no wonder that there’s barely a squeak about the knowledge economy, when the implied consensus of the public’s nihilistic approach to Covid is that cognitive ability no longer matters.\nIn addition to the potential to inflict long-term loss of health and life, the accelerating and looming threat of climate change makes it reckless to engage in activities that involve substantial, repeated travel considering the urgency of de-escalating emissions. WFH has been shown to cut over half of carbon emissions relative to in-person work, and that doesn’t even include carbon-intensive work flights that could be conducted over an hour-long Zoom meeting. Thought leaders feign ignorance of how surface temperature records have been broken for each of the past 12 months, even as researchers continue to be stunned by ocean temperature measurements."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you’re one of the 16.5% of employees who pay taxes in Malaysia you may be familiar with the many ways by which you can reduce your tax burden: tax reliefs. From purchases of computers to EPF contributions, there’s so many incentives that the government provides for you to save money, or even get some cash back in the process.\nBut wait a minute, you say. “I’m part of the 16%? The median income in Malaysia was RM5,873 a month in 20191, and I’m barely there.” But well, most of you aren’t your own household. And if you’re a single-earner household, your median income turns out to be just RM2,988 (2019), well below the taxable threshold of around RM3,000 a month. The Salaries and Wages Report, which provides more frequent updates on wage trends, indicates a median income of RM2,250 in 2021.\nSo yeah, if you’re familiar with Borang BE pat yourself on the back. You’re T20, you’ve made it as part of the socioeconomic elite.\nTax rebates are a great way for the government to claim to ‘fix’ problems without actually putting their money where their mouth is. There’s no real expense, just revenue forgone. But in truth, like a reverse Robin Hood, tax rebates steal from the poor to subsidise tax bills for the rich. So when a bunch of experts suggested in the media that tax rebates be used to encourage people to top up their EPF savings, I was rather unhappy.\nTo see why, let’s take a middle-of-the-road employee (‘Person A’) from a T20 household. In 2019, the median income per capita in a T20 household was RM3,854, or RM 46,248 a year2. For comparison, let’s take an individual (‘Person B’) that earns double that, say RM92,496. For the year of assessment 2022, Person A falls under the 8% tax bracket, whereas Person B falls under the 21% tax bracket. Ignoring all applicable tax reliefs, their tax payable would be as follows:\nSuppose that both Person A and B enjoy RM1,000 tax relief on top of the standard RM9,000 tax relief (for existing? idk). This reduces chargable income for each of these persons by RM10,000. However, for Person A, tax payable reduces by 800 (RM10,000 \\(\\times\\) 8%), while for Person B tax payable reduces by RM2,100. This means the government has forgone 2.6 times more tax revenue for the richer Person B than for Person A, and makes tax deductions highly regressive: the rich benefit more than the poor.\nPerhaps you object: Person B’s income means he contributes more to society, so he deserves additional relief proportionate to his contribution. Even by that logic, the government has forgone proportionately more revenue than Person B has earned.\nNot to mention that the tax relief system is the bane of ratepayers’ existence: you are required to keep records for several years. Some of us approach the tax authorities for voluntary audits in fear of getting in trouble some point in the future if we’ve misunderstood the tax code.\nNow, there may be a place for tax relief if the intention is to incentivise the rich to do certain pro-social things, for instance engage in risky investments to spur innovation, or even to purchase insurance, where their purchase of insurance could diversify risk pools and contribute to lower premiums. But it would be a lot more equitable to subsidise these behaviours directly. Insurance vouchers, for instance. Or topping up EPF contributions to a minimum, in the style of a negative income tax.\nIf we expanded relief for voluntary contribution to the EPF, only the well-off and financially sound can afford to contribute voluntarily to the EPF at an amount significant enough to make a dent on their tax bill3. Not to lose sight of the fact that while we lobby the government to lower our tax bills, the median savings of EPF members has halved to RM8,100 in 2022 from RM16,600 pre-Covid.\nWe need a real conversation about how to fund social security moving forward, lest retirement means poverty for the aging masses."

Using R with Windows has the big advantage of having binaries on CRAN available for the latest version of packages. In comparison, Linux does not, however if you use RStudio Package Manager as a package source you’ll have access to package binaries for Linux.\nWith R 4.0, compiling packages requires Rtools4.0, which requires adding the Rtools home to the .Renviron file. While I haven’t had problems with this setup, I’ve seen people facing issues on Twitter. Thank goodness we don’t have to install arbitrary Visual Studio dependencies like with some Python packages …\nEssentially, I think you may want to consider using WSL2 with R if you anticipate having compilation issues for your packages on Windows that could be sidestepped by using Linux.\nDownloading R binaries from conda is a great alternative, but conda’s pretty heavy and I wouldn’t recommend running R from conda in parallel with R, at least on Windows. This is because in my experience, the conda R instance looks for packages in the non-conda package library. This is something that’s being worked on; in addition, if you install packages from GitHub, it’s probably not a great idea to mix that with your conda R library."

(source)\nAt GRID Inc., my colleague and I were tasked to develop deep learning-based models to address client use cases as part of an internship programme. As a junior data scientist with practically no experience in deep learning, being tasked to develop deep learning systems was a daunting challenge.\nBut the biggest challenge of all wasn’t technical.\nThat’s not to say there weren’t difficult technical challenges to transitioning from delivering classes to a deep learning engineering role. Having to shift to working with Python and image data from my usual work processing numeric data in R was a steep learning curve, not to mention learning to organize a data science project in Python."

But if the client isn’t convinced that it’s useful, you’re not going to get recurring business. The client may not understand the technical merits of your project: you’re going to have to convince them that it is technically sound without getting too absorbed in the details.\nMoreover, even if you’re sharing to your own data science team, some members of your team may not be familiar with the domain you’re working in, and you’re going to have to make similar adjustments to your presentation/reporting to make sure it’s accessible to your audience.\nGranted, our roles weren’t client-facing, but we were challenged to make the systems relevant to the client all the same. One way to do this is to develop or pick metrics that are relevant to the use case, to make sure the client can relate to what you’re talking about.\nAs an example, in the context of regression problems, I strongly prefer using metrics that summarize the distribution of errors, e.g. root mean squared error (RMSE) rather than R-squared. Putting aside the many other downsides of the R-squared, its biggest drawback to me is its rather nuanced and commonly misunderstood definition. Reporting a metric like RMSE or MAPE (mean average percentage error) that’s in the same units as the outcome of interest is more straightforward and makes the metric more meaningful for the client."

On the other hand, the architectures we know about are known to work out for a number of use cases. Going over details of the architectures used is generally just unnecessary, although highlighting key differences between architectures that make a difference to your model’s performance can help your audience to understand your thought process.\nFor instance, in deep learning-based object detection, there is a speed-accuracy trade-off between region proposal network and regression-based architectures. This can be explained as a consideration in selecting the algorithm without going over implementation details.\ntl;dr Give just enough detail: not more than necessary, but no less than necessary either."

Alright. Here’s the chart:\n\nLet’s start with what graduate employability means. Honestly, I’ve no clue. The visual tells me nothing about that. Let’s do a quick Google search, shall we?\n\nSERDANG, 6 Mei – Kebolehpasaran graduan Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) menjangkau 82.2 peratus, iaitu yang tertinggi di kalangan institusi pengajian tinggi di negara ini.\nTimbalan Naib Canselor (Hal Ehwal Pelajar dan Alumni) UPM, Prof. Dato’ Dr. Mohammad Shatar Sabran berkata 82.2 peratus daripada graduan UPM memperoleh pekerjaan dalam tempoh tiga bulan selepas konvokesyen mereka. https://upm.edu.my/news/kebolehpasaran_graduan_upm_822_peratus_tertinggi_di_kalangan_ipt-25091?L=bm\n\nOkay, so I presume it measures what percentage of graduates obtained jobs within three months of that convocation. Awesome. We should really just put that in the chart, because calling this “graduate employability” doesn’t tell us much..\nNext, let’s think about how someone using the graphic will understand this chart.\nThe font for the numbers is quite large. But a key part of the visual is the length of the vertical ‘pillars’ supporting each of the ‘bubbles’.\nI’m no expert in perception, but let’s say people take the length of the ‘pillars’ to represent the metric.\nSurely people will think that the employability rate has improved a lot more than it has?\nThe increase of the rate from 2018 to 2019 was 2 percentage points. But we’re interested in the ratio of the 2019 to 2018 percentage. 82/80 implies an increase of 2.5%.\nThe line for 82% is 5 cm on my computer screen whereas the line for 80% is 2.3cm on my screen. That’s a ratio of 2.17 to 1, an increase of 117%.\nPut simply, the graph exaggerates the change in the employability rate by almost 50 times.\nThe cognitive dissonance while processing the chart is stunning. Looking at the chart, I would have thought the Ministry made great progress, while in fact it’s just made a scratch."

However, if you move your files around, you’ll have to change your file paths too.\nWhile looking for a Python alternative, I found a package rootpath which essentially does the same with the rootpath.detect() function.\nimport rootpath\nimport os \n\nROOT_DIR = rootpath.detect()\nos.chdir(ROOT_DIR)\nfile_path = \"data/interim/...\""

It looks like the first principal component captures a spectrum of constituency groups from high-Chinese constituencies to high-Sabahan constituencies. Note that the first principal component only captures 28% of the variance.\n    \nThe same exercise is done for the age variables. Its first principal component captures 61.4% of the variance.

odds\nThe coefficients are expressed in log-odds, so these are exponentiated to obtain relative odds.

The advantage of using marginal odds is that we can get an idea of actual, rather than relative probabilities (see here for details), however they can be quite tricky to interpret. The marginal effect for a continuous variable $X_k$ provides the instantaneous rate of change if the variable $X_k$ increased by an infinitesimal amount $\\Delta$, holding all other variables $X$ constant. See this for details. $$\\lim_{\\Delta \\to 0} \\Pr(Y = 1|X, X_k+\\Delta)- \\Pr(y=1|X, X_k)$$\nIn other words, what is the change in (log-)probabiity if the first principal component changes by an infinitesimal amount?\nThe means of each principal component will coincide with 0, therefore at 0 I get marginal effects at average race/age. This is visualised below."

While I have my reservations about their machine learning approach, I think it’s an interesting dataset, so I downloaded their data and code and played around with it in Python.\nFor those not familiar with Malaysia, some background:\nVariable names: agevars refers to proportions of people in several bins of age groups, racevars refers to proportions of people in each ethnic group, and features is the union of agevars and racevars. target is the outcome of the election."

    "text": "Ethnic diversity of constituencies\nUsing scipy‘s entropy function, I try to determine which parties win in ethnically ’diverse’ and ‘less-diverse’ constituencies. The boxplots below confirm what we already know from the boxplots above - that Gagasan Sejahtera appeals to a very homogenous group of voters.\n\nBN wins across diverse and non-diverse constituencies;\nPH also wins across diverse and non-diverse constituencies, but its median constituency is more diverse than BN’s median constituency.\nPAS wins in non-diverse constituencies.\n\nThe diversity index used here is the Shannon entropy index, given by $$H'=-\\Sigma p_i \\log{p_i}$$ The exponent of $H'$ has a nice interpretation. It is the effective number of species, i.e. how many species there would be if each species had an equal amount of observations. You can convince yourself that this is true by running the code exp(-(0.5*log(0.5)+0.5*log(0.5))) (in R), which should return the result 2, meaning the diversity in the data is effectively two equally sized classes.\nfrom scipy.stats import entropy\nentropy_const = np.array([entropy(ge14[racevars].iloc[i,:].tolist()) for i in range(len(ge14))])\n\n# use effective number of species instead https://medium.com/@sam.weinger/how-diverse-are-names-in-america-f74b07e031bd\neffective_number = np.exp(entropy_const)\n\nnp.mean(effective_number[ge14.target=='BN']), np.mean(effective_number[ge14.target=='PH']), np.mean(effective_number[ge14.target=='Gagasan Sejahtera'])\n(2.023986123800037, 2.4850578347860295, 1.2839901761045327)\nfg, ax = plt.subplots(nrows = 3, figsize = (5,5))\nsns.boxplot(effective_number[ge14.target=='BN'], ax = ax[0])\nax[0].set_title(\"BN\")\n\nsns.boxplot(effective_number[ge14.target=='PH'], ax = ax[1], color = 'r')\nax[1].set_title(\"PH\")\nsns.boxplot(effective_number[ge14.target=='Gagasan Sejahtera'], ax = ax[2], color = 'g')\nax[2].set_title(\"Gagasan Sejahtera\")\nplt.xlim(0,4)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\npng"

The weakness of using a linear model for classification problems is that the probabilities can be less than 0 or more than 1, which defies the rules of probability. Len Kiefer explores trimmed OLS for estimating effect sizes, where we eliminate observations where the predicted probabilities are less than 0 or more than 1 first, then re-estimate OLS. The code for trimmed OLS are as follows:\n\n# trimmed OLS\nreg %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  filter(.fitted &lt; 0 | .fitted &gt; 1) -&gt; out_of_bounds\n\ntitanic_training %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(var = '.rownames') %&gt;% \n  anti_join(out_of_bounds, \n            by = \".rownames\") %$%\n  lm(formula, data = .) -&gt; trimmed_ols\n\nAnd now time to evaluate.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In short, we do cross-validation to pick the right model. But what does that mean for our ‘final model’?\nLet’s take a step back and motivate the train-test split approach (otherwise known as the evaluation set approach). Like cross-validation, we perform the evaluation set approach because we want to have some idea of how our model performs in the real world.\n\nThe evaluation set approach\nA simple way to achieve this is to split our data so that the model is *trained* on one part of the data, and *evaluated* on the other part (‘holdout’). This is what we see at the start of most machine learning courses:\n\n\n\nevaluation set approach\n\n\nIn Python, this is what we do when we call train_test_split() from sklearn:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 0.3)\nfor R users, using the tidymodels infrastructure, rsample can be used to split training and holdout sets:\nlibrary(rsample) \n\ncar_split &lt;- initial_split(mtcars)\ntrain_data &lt;- training(car_split)\ntest_data &lt;- testing(car_split)\n\n\nTraining on the evaluation set\nUnfortunately for us, in practice, we use the holdout set a lot more than once. Today’s data scientist is spoiled for choice when it comes to algorithms: for gradient boosting alone, you have XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting, gbm etc., not to mention the numerous hyperparameters you have for any one algorithm. If you use the holdout set to guide your choice of hyperparameters, you are bound to overfit on your holdout set.\nThe no-free-lunch theorem further complicates this problem. Loosely speaking, the no-free-lunch theorem asserts that there is no One True Algorithm that has superior performance across all use cases. Given the above, the data scientist would have to test the algorithm multiple times to see which works best. With the evaluation set approach, this amounts to training on the holdout set.\n\n\nAnother holdout set\nIf you put this question up to the deep learning folks, they’ll provide you a seemingly simple solution: create two holdout sets. Pick the correct model on Holdout 1 (‘validation’), then evaluate the final model on Holdout 2 (‘holdout’):\n\n\n\ntrain, validation, holdout\n\n\nThis may not be ideal sometimes because:\n1. data is often limited: there may not be enough data for two holdout sets. Moreover, in cases where observations are time-sensitive, a TVH approach could reduce the generalizability of the chosen model if the time period of the shrinked training set is less relevant to the problem at hand.\n2. Additionally, depending on the observations picked in validation/holdout, test error can be highly variable (see ISLR for details).\n\n\nK-fold cross-validation\nAnd so we move on to cross-validation, in hopes that we can get around this limited-data problem. This diagram may be familiar to some of you:\n\n\n\n5-fold cross-validation\n\n\nIn (k-fold) cross-validation, we try to get at some semblance of generalization performance by resampling the development data. Slicing the development data into 5 folds, we train the data on 4 folds, and validate the resulting model on the remaining fold. We repeat this for each permutation of folds, and then average the validation score to obtain the cross-validated score.\n\n\nWhich is the final model?\nWhile performing cross-validation, we have trained K models to evaluate our training procedure. Which should be the final model?\nNone of the above! The purpose of cross-validation is merely to pick the correct procedure for fitting a model. Whether it be the algorithm or the hyperparameter search space, the purpose of cross-validation is to know what procedure works best for your data. The same procedure can be reused to re-fit the model on new data, and that should make up your final model.\n\nThe purpose of cross-validation is model checking, not model building (StackExchange)\n\nIn fact, once you’re done with cross-validation and picked your final model, you can, and should, re-train your model-building procedure on all the data you have. There is no reason to drop the holdout set once the optimal procedure has been selected."

No single model from the cross-validation process should actually be used as your final model1; cross-validation is merely a way to evaluate how well your modeling process works on repeated samples of your data, to get a better sense of how well your modeling choice works in the real world.\nIf you’re comparing estimator-to-estimator without tuning much, you’re at pretty low risk of overestimating model performance from model selection, so long as you don’t peek at your test set. Suppose I had three simple models:\ndict(zip(\n  [\"GaussianNB\", \"LogisticRegression\", \"RandomForestClassifier\"], \n  [round(i, 3) for i in [nb_scores.mean(), lr_scores.mean(), rf_scores.mean()]]\n))\n\n{'GaussianNB': 0.939, 'LogisticRegression': 0.947, 'RandomForestClassifier': 0.953}\nFrom the scores above, it seems that RandomForestClassifier should perform best out-of-sample."

For instance, if many features do not affect the target, a higher mix of L1 penalty may be more appropriate, whereas if each feature contributes a little to the target, the L2 penalty would be more appropriate. However, it is not clear how to pick the regularization term \\(\\lambda\\)."

A continuous search space is infinitely large :-(\n\nYou, the data scientist\nYou may not be satisfied with the predictive performance of the model we obtain, and as such you may try to search around the search space for a better hyperparameter value.\nSuppose you start with\nparameters = {'kernel':('linear', 'rbf'), 'C':[1, 10]}\nfind out RBF and C = 10 were selected by your search process, then proceed to run\nparameters = {'kernel': 'rbf', 'C':[9, 10, 11]}\nhoping to get better performance.\nThe problem is that you are almost certain to get better performance, since you are optimizing for the same cross-validation scheme. We’ve violated the rule that cross-validation is just for evaluation, and inadvertently used it for optimizing our model!\n\n\nWait … what just happened?\nTo see why this is an issue, let’s simplify this problem a little by substituting cross-validation with a validation set approach. Suppose you used a train-validation split on your data and used the test score to guide your hyperparameter choice.

We will choose the hyperparameter that performs best on the test set, but its generalizability is questionable.\n\n\nCan cross-validation save us?\nUsing cross-validation may not be enough. Suppose we had cross-validation split 1 with the following evaluation scores:\n\n\n\nC\nkernel\ncross-validated\n\n\n\n\n1\nlinear\n.95\n\n\n1\nrbf\n.91\n\n\n10\nlinear\n.96\n\n\n10\nrbf\n.90\n\n\n\nand again searched around the vicinity of C = 10:\n\n\n\nC\nkernel\ncross-validated\n\n\n\n\n8\nlinear\n.92\n\n\n9\nlinear\n.93\n\n\n10\nlinear\n.96\n\n\n11\nlinear\n.97\n\n\n\nyou would be selecting the hyperparameters that are optimal for the cross-validation setup, since the hyperparameter optimization process shares the same cross-validation setup as the hyperparameter evaluation process.

This is perfectly fine, as we are now trying to evaluate which hyperparameter search space/process works best, not which set of hyperparameters works best.\nThe final test set may have another set of hyperparameters.\nWhen you eventually retrain on all the data you have, you may get a different set of hyperparameters!

An example how this helps is how it may be easier to teach functional programming in purrr compared to base R, since the multivariate versions of the apply functions contain the data within the ellipsis argument, which is the last argument, versus with lapply()/sapply() where the data is the first argument.\nThe tidyverse is designed as a grammar, or perhaps a way to speak about the operations you’re running. dplyr is the tidyverse’s grammar for manipulating tabular data encapsulated in 6 verbs and their variants, whereas ggplot2 is the tidyverse’s grammar for constructing charts.\nWithin the tidyverse grammar, every function is a verb.

I find that dplyr helps me think about my analysis faster. I don’t deal with datasets so big that I really care how long my code takes to run, so long as I do it right. But my teaching days are over … for now."

    "text": "Learning algorithm\nTraining a GBM begins with initializing a simple model \\(f_0\\), so that the model at iteration 0 is:\n\\[F_0(\n\\textbf{x}\n)=f_0(\\textbf{x})\\]\nwhere \\(\\textbf{x}\\) denotes the feature input vector. \\(f_0\\) may be as simple as the average prediction. For a GBM modelling a single feature, the model may start off looking something like this3:\n\nThe idea behind gradient boosting is to adjust the model sequentially to ‘fix’ the errors.\n\nWhere the actual values are above \\(F_0\\), the model should be adjusted upwards;\nWhere the actual values are below \\(F_0\\), the model should be adjusted downwards;\n\nThe boosting approach to solving this problem is to fit a model to the errors \\(\\epsilon = y-F(\\textbf{x})\\) at every iteration. At every iteration, we add a model of the errors to fix the previous model’s mistakes.\n\nStated differently, the model at the first boosting stage is the sum of the initial model \\(F_0\\) and the model of the residuals \\(f_1\\):\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]Intuitively, the residuals \\(\\epsilon\\) indicate the direction in which the overall model should be nudged to get to the target value.\n\nGradient descent?\nIn practice, the residuals used to fit the learners are computed using the gradient of the loss function, and are also known as pseudoresiduals.\nIf we were to add the entirety of the model of the residuals \\(f_1\\):\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]\nthen it may not be necessary to train for further iterations, since \\(y=F_0(\\textbf{x})+\\epsilon\\)4. So we slow down training by adding only a fraction \\(\\eta\\) of the learner:\n\\[F_1(\\textbf{x})=F_0(\\textbf{x})+\\eta f_1(\\textbf{x})\\]\n\\(\\eta\\) is known as the learning rate. It’s also known as a shrinkage parameter, since it shrinks the contribution of each learner to the ensemble.\nOr more generally, for the \\(b\\)-th iteration:\n\\[F_b(\\textbf{x})=F_{b-1}(\\textbf{x})+\\eta f_b(\\textbf{x})\\]\nNotice how this parallels with gradient descent for neural networks, where the direction of adjustment for the \\(j\\)-th model parameter \\(\\theta_j\\) is guided by the sign of the gradient:\n\\[\\theta_{j} =\\theta_{j}-\\eta \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\theta_j}J(\\theta)\\]\nwhere \\(J(\\theta)\\) refers to the loss function.\nWith gradient boosting, the direction of the gradient is used to adjust the overall model directly instead of individual model parameters.\n\n\nHow many trees, then?\nIt follows that lowering the learning rate \\(\\eta\\) generally requires more learners to build an optimal model. By slowing the speed of adjustment, the learning algorithm is more likely to converge, but a large ensemble may be required for an optimal model5.\nAn approach to determining the number of learners required is known as early stopping. Additional learners are added until the point of diminishing returns, where there is no noticeable performance gain for adding new trees.\nSince the model is trained iteratively, it is possible to score the model at every iteration. The early_stopping_rounds argument in XGBoost checks the previous early_stopping_rounds for any improvement in the test score and trains the model for additional rounds only if improvements are observed.\nMake sure to use separate sets of data for determining early stopping rounds and evaluating models."

Monotonic constraints ensure that a specified relationship is either strictly increasing or decreasing. See https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/monotonic.html for details.\n\n\nFeature interaction constraints\nIn tree-based models, each additional level introduces interactions to the model. Interactions are where combinations of feature values matter to the model, and not just individual feature values. The additive structure of GBMs makes it possible to restrict interactions captured in a model by limiting the features used in each iteration.\n\nExplainable Boosting Machines train on one feature at a time and incorporate automatic detection of interactions, such that the resulting model can be directly interpreted by summing up across all trees.\nXGBoost allows users to specify which feature interactions are permitted. As an example, Scotiabank transforms XGBoost models trained with feature interaction constraints into a scorecard format for use in credit assessment."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis article was first published in the April 2024 issue of Penang Monthly.\nTaylor Swift, the queen of pop, transcends the realm of music. She’s a cultural force, a brand powerhouse, and according to Swifties in political leadership, a significant economic driver. Her relatable lyrics, narrative-driven albums, and social media engagement create a sense of community and shared experience. This fervent fanbase translates into dedicated concertgoers, enthusiastic merchandise buyers, and a loyal consumer base that fuels Swiftonomics.\nIntriguingly, Taylor Swift’s critically acclaimed Eras Tour has sparked bad blood within ASEAN. Leaders across Thailand and the Philippines have criticised Singapore for entering an agreement with Swift’s team to host concerts exclusively in Southeast Asia. Uncharacteristically, Malaysia’s traditionally concert-averse conservative bloc has joined the Swiftian gold rush, with Bersatu leader Sasha Lyna Abdul Latiff asking the Anwar administration to explain the outcome of past negotiations between the Malaysian government and Taylor Swift’s team during the Ismail Sabri administration.\nASEAN leaders wish Taylor Swift would schedule a concert in their respective countries, not purely out of fear of missing out. The Eras Tour is the first tour to gross over USD 1 billion globally, and its companion concert film, ‘Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour’, topped the record for highest-grossing concert film at over USD 261 billion, more than doubling the previous record held by ‘Justin Bieber: Never Say Never’ in 2011. The US leg of the Eras Tour generated USD 4.6 billion in direct consumer spending on expenses, including tickets, outfits, merchandise, food & beverages and travel, according to QuestionPro estimates. At the same time, Economic Effects NET named the Eras Tour Japan’s biggest-ever music event by economic impact, generating USD 229.6 million across four Tokyo shows. Even so, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman wonders out loud, why doesn’t Taylor Swift earn more than she does?"

    "text": "Look What You Made Singapore Do\nBeyond short-term gains, Singapore bets on the Eras Tour and other mega-events to improve its allure to global entertainment acts, riding on the back of pent-up demand following the relaxation of COVID-19 public health restrictions across the globe. While the island-state may lack homegrown cultural credentials, it isn’t for lack of trying. In 2012, Gallup ranked Singaporeans as the most emotionless people globally. Now graced by the likes of Bruno Mars, Coldplay, and Ed Sheeran, Singapore is banking on their halo effect to rehabilitate its image into Asia’s “events and entertainment capital”. \nThe appeal of mega-events has historically been a double-edged sword. World leaders’ pleas for Taylor Swift’s patronage echo the race for Olympic host nations in not-too-distant memory. Concerns about environmental impact, fueled by Taylor Swift’s sizable carbon footprint from private jet travel, loom large. Estimates for 2022—during which Taylor Swift was not touring—suggest that her private jet travel produced a whopping 8,300 tonnes of carbon emissions, equivalent to 1,800 (average) human beings in a year. \nMoreover, it is unclear how the benefits of a Taylor Swift tour stop will be distributed within local communities. Matherson (2004) argues that businesses reap the lion’s share of the profits from mega-events, which are unlikely to recirculate in the economy. Further, KPMG estimates that of the just over AUD 100 million profit that Taylor Swift is to earn from the Australian leg of the Eras Tour, the net impact of the tour on the Australian economy would be just a tenth of that: AUD 10.6 million, equivalent to 0.002% of Australia’s quarterly gross domestic product (GDP)."

    "text": "I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor’s Version?)\nBack home, concert enthusiasts in Malaysia have endured disappointment after disappointment. With Malaysia’s reputation for shutting down concerts in response to protests over performers’ stagewear, the Eras Tour snub comes on the heels of opposition to Coldplay’s November 2023 Malaysia show over their support for gender diversity. \nFormer Minister of Youth and Sports Syed Saddiq characterised the cancellation of Malaysian Coldplay tour dates as missing “an economic lottery”, citing substantial spillovers in the transport and F&B sector. Likewise, the Arts, Live Festival and Events Association lamented the impact of protests on “our international business environment and reputation”, citing “millions in tourist income and benefit hotels, transportation, food and beverage, retail and more” resulting from Coldplay’s six sold-out shows in Singapore. \nThe uncertain business environment this has brought about bodes poorly for the local entertainment industry. Singapore’s successful efforts in ensuring a Swift landing must be viewed in light of its historical disadvantage in homegrown talent, in which Malaysia arguably has the upper hand. However, multiple factors in Malaysia threaten to suppress local cultural dynamics. The allure of dominant international acts such as Taylor Swift overshadows the real problems faced by local Malaysian artists, constrained as they are by shifting goalposts.\nIt is of little comfort that much of the purported spillover effects of mega-events are, more often than not, an exaggeration. Economically, Malaysia has little to lose beyond the creative economy, which contributes just under 2% of GDP (2019), if it resists the Taylor Swift FOMO plaguing the ASEAN region. For any administration in power, the uncertain economic benefits are not worth incurring confrontation from religious fundamentalists. The prospect of Malaysia becoming a regional destination for megastars, as Singapore aspires to be, is politically infeasible."
